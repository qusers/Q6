\section{INTRODUCTION} Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can be
used to sample the thermally accessible region of conformational
space of a microscopic model of a molecular system. From the
ensemble of sampled structures and their associated potential
energies (given by the force field or molecular mechanics
potential energy function) it is, in principle, possible to
calculate free energies. Quantities such as binding free energies,
solvation free energies and activation free energies are
particularly interesting to calculate because they are the direct
result of thermodynamic or kinetic experiments. It is thus
possible both to quantitatively verify calculated results against
experimental data and to make predictions which can be tested
experimentally.

Q~\cite{Marelius:1999} is a set of tools for such calculations,
tailored for some specific kinds of free energy calculations,
namely, (I) free energy perturbation (FEP) simulations
\cite{Kollman:1993,Beveridge:1989}, (II) empirical valence bond
(EVB) calculations \cite{Warshel:1988,Aaqvist:1993} of reaction
free energies and (III) linear interaction energy (LIE)
calculations\cite{Aaqvist:1994,Jones-Hertzog:1997,Hansson:1998} of
receptor-ligand binding affinities.

The main features which distinguish Q from other MD packages are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The spherical boundary.} Q is intended for free energy calculations
in biomolecular systems solvated in a spherical droplet of
explicit water molecules. Using a spherical boundary
\cite{Warshel:1978,Berkowitz:1982,Brunger:1984} makes it possible
to limit the size of the simulated system, $i.e.$ to focus the
simulation on a smaller region such as a binding site, and also
makes accurate treatment of long-range electrostatics rather
inexpensive.
\item \textbf{The flexibility in choice of force field.} The force fields
are defined in parameter files, separate from the program and the
choice of force field is thus simply a matter of which parameter
file to use.
\item \textbf{The ease of use and learning.} The simulation control input and
force field definition files are organised in a flexible way and
easy to understand and modify. The programs give extensive
diagnostics when problems are encountered.
\item \textbf{It runs on any computer and simulates any number of particles.}
By using dynamic memory allocation Q can simulate biomolecules of
moderate size on a personal computer, or very large molecular
systems on a super-computer, without any modifications of the
program.
\end{itemize}

Two new features that have been added in version 5.0:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Periodic boundary condition.} The periodic boundary
allows an additional way to perform calculations.

\item \textbf{Parallel version.} By using more than one computer a
single simulation can be executed faster. The parallel version is
especially useful when simulating large systems, $e.g.$ the
systems that are used with the periodic boundary condition.
\end{itemize}

%Old stuff:
%The program is thus not intended for simulations of, let's say,
%the dynamics of an entire protein in a large periodic box of
%solvent. A main reason for this restriction of the scope is to
%keep things as simple and efficient as possible and, since the
%focus is on free energy calculations, to allow simulations that
%take into account long-range electrostatics properly without the
%use of cut-offs.

\section{USER GUIDE}
The structure of Q resembles that of many other MD simulation
programs. The main program is Qdyn which carries out the actual
trajectory calculations. Besides normal input control data, it
needs the type of data usually referred to as the molecular
topology. This is a file containing information about how atoms
are bonded to each other etc. together with all the parameters of
the force field (FF) to be used. This topology file is created
with the preparation program Qprep which is an interactive program
that uses pdb (Protein Data Bank) coordinate files together with
FF specific files to generate the topology. Qprep can also be used
for various other data transformation purposes as described below.
Input data for FEP, EVB or receptor-ligand complex simulations is
given in a separate file, referred to below as the fep file. The
fep file lists atoms to be transformed, called Q-atoms and force
field parameters for the different states in perturbation
simulations. For analysis of the computations the main tool is
Qfep which is a program that carries out FEP and EVB calculations
of free energies utilising energy data produced by Qdyn. A number
of utility programs (trajectory and energy averaging, radial
distribution functions, ...) are also provided. The general
outline of Q is shown in figure \ref{fig:overview}.

\begin{figure}[h]

with Q. The white boxes represent files and also show typical file
name extensions. The black boxes are programs.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the following sections we will go through the normal sequence
of steps for preparing a topology file with Qprep and then
describe in detail the input data required for running MD
simulations with Qdyn.

\subsection{Preparing a molecular topology} The topology file
prepared with the program Qprep contains all the information about
the molecular system needed for a simulation with Qdyn. To make a
topology you need

\begin{itemize}
\item A molecular fragment library file describing the atoms and connectivity
of each protein residue, ligand etc., collectively referred to as
library entries.
\item A force-field parameter file.
\item Coordinates for all (non-solvent) atoms in the form of a PDB file.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preparing coordinates} The PDB file format
\cite{pdb} used for co-ordinate input to Qprep is a fixed format,
$i.e.$, the number of spaces between columns of data is significant
and tab characters are not permitted. Case is significant -
lower-case letters should not be used. Only ATOM and HETATM
records are read by Qprep, all other records are ignored.

Hydrogen atoms are not required - their coordinates will be
generated by Qprep in such a way that the bond and angles to the
hydrogen atom are at an energy minimum. To further control the
placement of hydrogens, a special torsion potential defined in the
fragment library entry may be included. See
[\textbf{build\_rules}] on page \pageref{tab:buildrules}. If
hydrogen atom coordinates are given in the PDB file, they will not
be altered.

When a structure containing more than one molecule is loaded into
Qprep, the program will identify the boundaries between molecules
either by the type of fragment or using `gap' marker lines.
Fragments which are monomers in a polymer chain, like amino acids,
have designated `head' and `tail' atoms in their library entries,
defining how they should be connected to the neighbouring
residues. Library entries describing separate molecules such as
solvent or ligands do not contain this linkage information. To
distinguish two peptide chains from each other it is necessary to
introduce a gap marker line in the PDB file after the last atom of
the first molecule. The gap marker consists of the word GAP in
capital letters on a separate line.

The numbering of atoms in the PDB is not significant. Note that
Qprep will renumber all atoms in a single sequence starting at
one. This is necessary in order to incorporate hydrogen atoms in
the sequence. The result is thus that \textit{atom numbers in the
PDB file read by Qprep and PDB files generated by Qprep will be
different}. Residue numbers are used merely to distinguish one
residue from the next and the residues will also be renumbered by
Qprep. Residue numbers must be numeric, alphanumeric identifiers
such as 60A sometimes encountered in the protein data bank are not
permitted.

Protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography are
normally refined with a large number of water molecules. Some of
these well-ordered water molecules may be important for the
structure and function of the protein and should be included in
the simulation. However, most of the crystallographic waters
surrounding the protein can be removed. In fact, the presence of a
large number of water molecules around the protein surface will
disturb the solvation algorithm leading to inhomogenous water
density. Qprep assumes that solvent molecules appear after solute
molecules in the PDB file and keeps track the last solute atom.
Solvent molecules are identified by their residue names. The list
of solvent residue names is a user-setable preference in Qprep
(see Setting preference on page \pageref{setting_pref}) with the
default value WAT, HOH, H2O, SPC, TIP3. Solvent molecules added by
the solvation algorithm will appear at the end of the atom
sequence. Solvent molecules outside the simulation sphere (more
than water radius + 2~{\AA} from solvent centre) will be excluded
like solute atoms outside the solute sphere.

\subsubsection{Selecting a force field} Q is designed to run with
a wide selection of force fields. Fragment libraries and force
field parameters for AMBER95, AMBER/OPLS, OPLS-AA, CHARMM v.22,
GROMOS87 and GROMOS96 are supplied in with the program. The
corresponding library and FF parameter files are listed in table
\ref{tab:FF} on page \pageref{tab:FF}. In addition to all the
interaction parameters, a Q force field parameter file also
include overall properties of the force field, such as the van der
Waals parameter combination rule. Selecting a force field is thus
equivalent to loading the appropriate fragment library and
parameter file into Qprep.

\subsubsection{Adding force field library entries}
Your simulations will probably include molecular fragments other
than the amino acid residues and solvent molecules that are
included in the standard library files and you therefore need to
write a library entry for each 'new' residue, ligand, co-factor or
other molecule. We suggest you keep your library entries in a
separate file rather than adding to the standard library file.
Load first the standard library and then your own into Qprep. If
you need to modify an entry in the standard library, add the
modified entry (keeping the same name) to your own library file -
it will replace the old entry when loaded.

The best starting point for generating a new entry is to copy an
old one, this ensures the correct syntax. For details, see the
section Fragment library file format on page
\pageref{subsubsec:fragment_lib_f_f}.

\subsubsection{Running Qprep}
Qprep is a command-oriented program designed to be run
interactively. The first thing you need to learn about Qprep is
that there is a help command which gives a list of available
commands. The program's input parser will prompt for the
parameters required for each command but will also accept complex
command lines including the parameters. Thus, you may either enter
the command \textbf{readlib} and await the prompt 'Name of
molecular library' or you may type \textbf{readlib
my{\_}ligands.lib} on one line.

A good deal of effort has been spent to make Qprep handle errors
gracefully. When a problem is encountered in a fragment library,
parameter file or PDB file, you will be notified but the
processing of the file will proceed, thus exposing also errors
later in the file. After correcting the problem you simply read
the file again without the need to restart the program.

The different steps to generate a topology with Qprep are
described below, in the sequence they are normally executed. More
detailed information is available in the section Topology
preparation reference on page \pageref{subsec:top_prep_ref}.

\textbf{Loading fragment libraries}\\*[0.25cm] Use the
\textbf{readlib} command to load fragment libraries. Many
libraries may be loaded by repeating the \textbf{readlib} command
for each of them. Note that if one entry name occurs more than
once, the latest definition takes precedence. A warning message is
issued when a library entry is overloaded.

Errors encountered while reading a library will be displayed and
after they have been corrected, the library may be loaded again.
To remove all library entries from memory, use the
\textbf{clearlib} command.

\textbf{Loading force field parameters}\\*[0.25cm] Use the
\textbf{readprm } command to load force field parameters. As
opposed to the case with fragment libraries, only a single
parameter file can be loaded. If you need to modify the parameter
file, edit and save it and load it again. It is not necessary to
reload fragment libraries or the structure.

\textbf{Loading coordinates}\\*[0.25cm] Use the \textbf{readpdb}
command to load the molecular structure file. Before loading the
structure, the program will verify that all the required library
entries are loaded and that the number of heavy atoms of each
fragment is correct. Only one file can be loaded - reading another
file clears the previously loaded structure. This is useful as you
reload the same file after correcting a problem.

\textbf{Choosing boundary condition}\\*[0.25cm] Use the
\textbf{boundary} command to set the boundary condition; sphere or
box. When a boundary has been chosen the centre and radius in the
spherical case, and boxlengths in the periodical case are
specified. It is important that the boundary condition defined in
the topology file is consistent with the boundary condition used
when running dynamics with Qdyn.

\textbf{Adding solvent}\\*[0.25cm] Use the \textbf{solvate}
command to add solvent molecules to the loaded structure. Using
spherical boundary solvent can be generated by any of the
following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item Using randomly oriented molecules on a grid. This option does not depend
on any solvent coordinate file but only asks which library entry
should be used. The density is specified in the library entry.
\item By reading solvent coordinates from a solvent file. The solvent file is
similar to a PDB file, see Solvent file format on page
\pageref{subsubsec:solvent_file_format}. The solvent file contains
coordinates for a sphere or box of solvent. In the case of a box,
it will be replicated in all directions as needed and can thus be
used to solvate a system of any size.
\item By reading solvent coordinates from a restart file from a previous
simulation of the same molecular system.
\end{itemize}

When using one of the two first methods, Qprep first fills a
sphere completely with solvent and then deletes molecules where
heavy atoms are closer than a threshold distance to any heavy atom
in the loaded structure. The threshold distance is controlled by
the Qprep preference value \textbf{solvent{\_}pack}.
Crystallographic solvent molecules (in the PDB file loaded by
readpdb) more than 2~{\AA} outside the solvent sphere will be
excluded from the simulation to avoid excessive radial restraining
forces.

If periodic boundary is used it is not possible to use a solvent
file with a sphere of solvent. Moreover the threshold distance is
also applied to solvent molecules near the boundary, to avoid
crashes between solvent molecules in neighbouring boxes.

At present, the choice of solvent is limited to tri-atomic
molecules like the SPC\cite{Berendsen:1981} and
TIP3P\cite{Jorgensen:1983} water models or methanol in an extended
atom representation.

Note: Make sure that crystallographic water molecules and waters
added by the solvate command have \textit{the same residue name}!
Otherwise Qprep will mark the topology as mixed-solvent, which is
not implemented in Qdyn at present.

\textbf{Adding cross-link bonds}\\*[0.25cm] Cross-link bonds such
as disulphide bridges in proteins are not generated automatically
{\-} they are not defined in the fragment library. Extra bonds can
be added automatically by searching the solute molecules for close
but not bonded atom pairs, or manually by specifying atom numbers.
To generate cross-link bonds automatically, use the \textbf{xlink}
command. For each close atom pair found, you need to confirm or
reject the making of a bond. To add bonds manually, use the
\textbf{addbond} and specify the atoms to be bonded, either by
atom numbers or in the form residue{\_}number:atom{\_}name.

\textbf{Generating the topology}\\*[0.25cm] The \textbf{maketop}
command is used to create the topology in memory. The only input
for this command is a name for the topology. The process involves
the following steps which are all carried out by the maketop
routine without further user input:

\begin{itemize}
\item Setting atom types and partial charges.
\item Generating the lists of bonds, bond angles, torsion angles and improper torsions.
\item Generating the neighbour exclusion and 1-4 neighbour lists.
\item Generating coordinates for hydrogen atoms not included in the loaded structure.
\item Marking atoms outside the simulation sphere as excluded
\item Calculation of the `effective solvent radius' used in the
simulation to ensure correct density of the solvent. This radius
which is based on the number and spatial distribution of solute
and solvent atoms in the sphere, typically differs somewhat from
the radius used in the solvation step.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Verifying the topology}\\*[0.25cm] The successful
generation of a topology in the step above is no guarantee that it
is correct. Fortunately Qprep offers a number of commands to check
the topology:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Checkbonds} is used to list bonds with a potential energy
exceeding a specified threshold. This helps to identify errors in
the connectivity.
\item \textbf{Checkangs} lists angles with energies over a threshold.
\item \textbf{Checktors} lists torsion angles with energies over a threshold.
\item \textbf{Checkimps}  lists high energy improper torsion angles. This is
a very important step for users of force fields with harmonic
improper potentials (GROMOS, charmm) since with a non-periodic
potential it makes a huge difference if the angle is $e.g.$
-179$^{o}$ instead of +179$^{o}$ if the (single) energy minimum is
at +180$^{o}$ although the structural difference is small.
\textit{Impropers with the wrong sign give rise to high energies
and strong forces which will distort the molecule during the
simulation and must be corrected.} (This is not a problem with
periodic improper torsion potentials used in the other force
fields.) The sign of the angle depends on the order of the bonds
in the fragment library entry, each permutation of the sequence of
the bonds involved will change the sign of the angle. Instead of
modifying library entries, reloading the libraries and remaking
the topology, the \textbf{changeimp} command can be used to flip
the sign of selected impropers or of all impropers with energy
exceeding a threshold value.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Writing topology and coordinate files}\\*[0.25cm] The
final step in making a topology is saving it to a file by using
the \textbf{writetop} command.

You will also need to make a PDB (or mol2, see below) file from
the topology to see the new numbers of the atoms. These are the
atom numbers you need to refer to when setting up restraints and
topology modifications for perturbation simulations. Use the
\textbf{writepdb} command to write a PDB file containing all the
atoms of the topology.

\textbf{Setting preferences}\label{setting_pref}\\*[0.25cm] A
number of parameters that affect the operation of Qprep, $e.g.$
during solvation, but which are not normally changed are not
required as input to the commands. These parameters may be changed
by experience users by the preference mechanism in Qprep.

The \textbf{prefs} command is used to list the values of
user-setable parameters and the \textbf{set} command to change a
value.

The preference parameters and their default values are listed in
the table on page \pageref{subsubsec:Qprep_preferences}.

\subsection{Running dynamics with Qdyn}
Once a molecular topology file has been generated with Qprep, you
can carry out MD, FEP and EVB simulations with Qdyn. The
simulation can have either spherical or periodic boundary
condition, and can be executed either sequentially or in parallel.

In this section we will describe the basic functions of Qdyn and
go through the different options that are available for control of
the dynamics runs. There are two main input files that are used to
set up the dynamics specifications:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Qdyn input file that controls things like time-step, temperature,
cut-offs, restraints etc. \item The FEP file which is an auxiliary
file whose function is to redefine the topology information for
certain atoms. This enables the explicit control over selected
force field parameters that is necessary for FEP and EVB
calculations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Simulation procedure}
The MD simulation required for a free energy calculation often
proceeds in multiple stages. Normally, the initial stage is run at
a very low temperature with strong coupling to the temperature
bath (similar to energy minimisation) to relax strain in the
initial structure. Then may follow stepwise heating of the
simulated system and equilibration for some time at the target
temperature. After this comes the main simulation during which
energy and structure data is collected. For perturbation
simulations, this phase is composed of a series of simulations
using intermediate potentials defined by different sets of weight
coefficients for the FEP states.

A separate Qdyn input file is used for each sub-simulation. It is
therefore practical to prepare a command file (shell script or
batch file) which executes all the sub-simulations sequentially.
The name of the input file is passed to Qdyn as the first (and
only) argument on the command line. (It is not possible to use
redirection of the standard input stream by the $<$ operator.) A
simple example of such a file where Qdyn is invoked once for each
input file and the output redirected to a log file follows:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Multi-stage simulation command file}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l l X|}
  \hline
  Qdyn4 & relax.inp & $>$ & relax.log \\
  Qdyn4 & eq1.inp   & $>$ & eq1.log \\
  Qdyn4 & eq2.inp   & $>$ & eq2.log \\
  Qdyn4 & eq3.inp   & $>$ & eq3.log \\
  Qdyn4 & data1.inp & $>$ & data1.log \\
  Qdyn4 & data2.inp & $>$ & data2.log \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Output generated by Qdyn} The different data files
generated by Qdyn are (shown in the overview in
\figurename~\ref{fig:overview}):

\begin{itemize}
\item General information about the progress of the simulation including
energy summaries and temperature is written to the standard output
device and normally redirected to a log file.
\item Final coordinates and velocities are written to a `restart' file to be
used to start the next sub-simulation and, after conversion to a
structure file (see Analysing structures from the simulation on
page \pageref{subsubsec:Analysing_struc_f_t_sim}, for viewing the
final structure. This file is also updated during the simulation
and if the forces and velocities become too large and the
simulation is terminated prematurely. The file thus also serves a
diagnostic purpose.
\item Energy data for Q-atoms in each FEP state is written to an
energy file every few time steps (determined in the input file).
\item Coordinates for all or a subset of atoms are written to a trajectory
file at regular intervals (determined in the input file).
\end{itemize}

The restart and energy files are Fortran binary files. The
trajectory file follows the DCD format also used in other MD
programs (Charmm, X-plor) and can be read by many visualisation
and trajectory animation programs.

\subsubsection{Preparing Qdyn input files}\label{subsubsec:prep_qdyn_inp_f}
In this overview the various aspects of defining the simulation
set-up are introduced. For more complete information, see Qdyn
input file format on page \pageref{subsubsec:Qdyn_inp_file_form}.

The Qdyn input file contains the specification of the dynamics
simulation. It is a text file divided into sections, starting with
a section heading and containing information on the different
aspects of the simulation. The sections are of two kinds:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sections where each line consists of a keyword and a values, with
different keywords on each line.
\item Sections where all the lines
have the same formatting and together constitute a data set. No
keywords are used here.
\end{itemize}

Only a few sections are mandatory, most are optional and they may
appear in any order. The formatting within a section is flexible
in that blank lines are permitted as well as comments (starting
with !, {\#} or *) at the end of lines or on separate lines. The
format of the data in each record within a section is free (white
space is not significant), but all data in the record must be on
the same line.The units used are based on {\AA}, K and kcal/mol
(see Units on page \pageref{subsec:units}).

\textbf{Dynamics control information}\\*[0.25cm] The section
[\textbf{MD}] is normally the first in the input file the most
apparently required section, since it defines the core parameters
of the simulation like the number of time steps, their size and
the temperature. Below is an example of a basic MD section in an
input file:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l X|}
  \hline
  [MD]             & \\
  steps            & 10000 \\
  stepsize         & 2.0 \\
  temperature      & 300 \\
  shake{\_}solvent & on \\
  shake{\_}solute  & off \\
  lrf              & on \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\textbf{Periodic boundary conditions}\\*[0.25cm] The
[\textbf{PBC}] section contains options and settings for
simulations with periodic boundary. The mere existence of the
section header [\textbf{PBC}] is enough to indicate the boundary
condition. Additional options is added as exemplified below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l X|}
  \hline
  [PBC]                  & \\
  rigid{\_}box{\_}centre & on \\
  constant{\_}pressure   & on \\
  max{\_}volume{\_}displ & 65 \\
  pressure               & 1.5 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

The rigid{\_}box{\_}centre option gives a periodic box with fixed
coordinates instead of centering the box around the solute. In the
above example the Monte-Carlo constant pressure algorithm,
described in \cite{Wennerstroem}, is performed with target
pressure 1.5 bar and maximum volume displacement 65 {\AA}$^{3}$.

\textbf{Non-bonded interactions} \\*[0.25cm] Cut-off radii for the
non-bonded interactions for different categories of atoms are
given in the section [\textbf{cut-offs}], as exemplified below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l X|}
  \hline
  [cut-offs]         & \\
  solute{\_}solute   & 10 \\
  solvent{\_}solvent & 10 \\
  solute{\_}solvent  & 10 \\
  q{\_}atom          & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

The q{\_}atom entry defines the cut-off for interactions between
Q-atoms and non-Q-atoms. No cut-off is used for interactions among
Q-atoms. When using periodic boundary conditions, make certain all
cut-off radii are less than half the shortest boxlength.

\textbf{Sphere}\\*[0.25cm] The \textbf{sphere} section defines
parameters concerning the spherical boundary. The most frequently
used parameter is the shell\_radius that allow the user to
restrain solute atom in a shell to their original coordinates as
defined in the topology.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l X|}
  \hline
  [sphere]    &    & \\
  shell\_radius & 18 & !Restrain solvent in inner shell \\
  shell\_force & 10 & !Restraining force constant \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\textbf{Solvent}\\*[0.25cm] The [\textbf{solvent}] section
controls the solvent boundary restraints when simulating with a
spherical boundary. This section is thus omitted when periodic
boundary is used. It is possible to fine-tune the restrains, but
the default values used if no data is given are adequate for most
simulations. The contents may often be as simple as:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l X|}
  \hline
  [solvent]    &    & \\
  polarisation & on & !Enable solvent polarisation restraints \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\textbf{Update and data collection intervals}\\*[0.25cm] The
frequencies of regular events in the simulation are defined in the
section [\textbf{intervals}]. These events are the regeneration of
the non-bonded pair lists and the writing of energies or
coordinates to the energy, trajectory and output files. Example:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l X|}
  \hline
  [intervals] &     & \\
  non{\_}bond & 25  & \\
  output      & 5   & \\
  energy      & 0   & !No energy file \\
  trajectory  & 100 &  \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

This example specifies that the non-bonded pair lists should be
regenerated every 25 time steps, energy summaries written to the
terminal or log file every 5 steps, no energy file is to be
written and coordinates written to the trajectory every 100 steps.

\textbf{Trajectory}\\*[0.25cm] If the coordinates of only a subset
of the atoms are to be stored in a trajectory file, the selection
of atoms is done in the section [\textbf{trajectory{\_}atoms}],
which could look as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l X|}
  \hline
  [trajectory{\_}atoms]      & & \\
  heavy not excluded residue & 1 & 104 \\
  residue                    & 105 & 106 \\
  residue                    & 109 & \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

In this atom mask the heavy atoms of residues 1 to 104 which are
inside the simulation sphere and all atoms of residues 105-106 and
109 are selected. For further information see Atom masks on page
\pageref{subsubsec:atom_masks}.

\textbf{Files}\\*[0.25cm] The names of files to be read and
written are grouped together in this section. A topology file and
a name for the final coordinates file must always be specified
here. A restart file may be specified to start the simulation
using the final coordinates and velocities from a previous
simulation of the same system. For perturbation simulations the
name of an FEP file is needed. If trajectory and energy files
should be generated they need to be named here.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l X|}
  \hline
  [files]    & \\
  topology   & molecule.top \\
  final      & data{\_}01.re \\
  trajectory & data{\_}01.dcd \\
  energy     & data{\_}01.en \\
  fep        & molecule.fep \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\textbf{FEP state weight coefficients $\lambda $}\\*[0.25cm] For
multi-state perturbation simulations the mapping vector $\lambda $
whose components are the weight coefficients for the FEP states is
given on a single line under the section heading
[\textbf{lambdas}]. For a simple two-state mapping potential with
70{\%} of state 1 and 30{\%} of state 2 it would look like this:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
  \hline
  [lambdas] \\
  0.70 0.30 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\textbf{Restraints}\\*[0.25cm] Several types of geometrical
restraints can be applied to the simulated system to eliminate
large movements, maintain interatomic distances or to stop the
diffusion of a solute towards the sphere boundary. The most
straight-forward type of restraints are harmonic potentials
applied to restrain a sequence of atoms to their initial
coordinates (in the topology file). This type of restraining is
specified in the [\textbf{sequence{\_}restraints}] section and
requires only the number of the first and last atom of the
sequence and a force constant. The restraints may be applied to
heavy atoms only or to all atoms in the sequence. Instead of
restraining each atom individually to its initial position, the
set of atoms can be restrained as a whole to its initial
geometrical centre. In this case identical forces are applied to
all the atoms. This alternative, used with a low force constant,
is useful $e.g.$ to keep a small solute molecule at the centre of
the simulation sphere without hindering its tumbling motion
(rotation). Both variants are exemplified below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l l l X|}
  \hline
  \multicolumn{5}{|l|}{[sequence{\_}restraints]} \\
  21 & 40 & 5.0 & 0 & \\
  65 & 72 & 2.0 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Here, atoms 21 to 40 are restrained to their initial positions by
5.0 kcal$\cdot $mol$^{-1}\cdot ${\AA}$^{-2}$ but hydrogens are
excepted (0). Atoms 65 to 72 including hydrogens (1) are
restrained as a group to their initial geometrical centre (1).

Restraints on individual atoms are not restricted to use the
initial position as a reference since the "target" position is
specified in the input. The restraint may be applied only in a
single FEP state or in all states. In the first case the force is
scaled by the weight coefficient $\lambda $ for that state.
Different force constants may also be used for the x, y and z
axes. By setting one or two force constants to zero, the atom will
be restrained to a line or a plane, respectively. An example of an
[\textbf{atom{\_}restraints}] specification follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
  \hline
  [atom{\_}restraints] \\
  8 \; 82.5 \; 28.32 \; 72.6 \; 5. \; 5. \; 5. \; 0 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

In this case atom 8 is restrained to the point (x,~y,~z) =
(82.5,~28.32,~72.6) with 5.0 kcal$\cdot $mol$^{-1}\cdot
${\AA}$^{-2}$ along all axes in all FEP states (0).

The distance between two atoms may be restrained using either a
standard harmonic potential or a flat-bottomed harmonic well
potential, by adding an entry under the heading
[\textbf{distance{\_}restraints}] as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
  \hline
  [distance{\_}restraints] \\
  13 \; 20 \; 4.5 \; 5.0 \; 10.0 \; 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Atoms 13 and 20 are here held together by a flat-bottomed harmonic
well potential which is zero between 4.5 and 5.0 {\AA} and has a
force constant of 10.0 kcal$\cdot $mol$^{-1}\cdot ${\AA}$^{-2}$
for other distances. It is active in FEP state 1 only.

Another means of restricting the overall motion of a molecule
(when using spherical boundary) is to apply a soft-wall or
half-harmonic restraint outside a given radius from the (solvent)
sphere centre. This is done in the section
[\textbf{wall{\_}restraints}] $e.g.$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l l l l l l X|}
  \hline
  \multicolumn{7}{|l|}{[wall{\_}restraints]} \\
  80  & 99  & 14.0 & 5.0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  102 & 102 & 14.0 & 5.0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

In this example atoms 80 to 99 and 102 will experience an inward harmonic force
if they are beyond 14~{\AA} from the sphere centre. The force constant is
5.0~kcal$\cdot $mol$^{-1}\cdot ${\AA}$^{-2}$ but force will not be applied to
hydrogen atoms (last 0). \emph{D$_e$} is the depth of the Morse potential and
\emph{a }is the exponential coefficient of the Morse term. For obvious reasons
the [\textbf{wall{\_}restraints}] section is not used in combination with
periodic boundary conditions. One can choose between harmonic or Morse
potential.

\subsubsection{Qdyn input file examples}
We give two annotated examples below. The first is the simplest
possible input file, using default values for all optional
parameters. The second is a bit more elaborate and exemplifies the
use of many extra options such as special restraints. Detailed
information about the data in each section is found in the section

\subsubsection{FEP file}
The purpose of the FEP file is to define a set of atoms as Q-atoms
and to redefine their interaction parameters. All kinds of
force-field parameters for these atoms can be controlled and
several different "states" can be defined. The parameters for the
different states may differ very little, $e.g.$, in the van der
Waals parameters of a single atom, or the states can represent
different valence bond structures. A typical application of the
latter case would be to model reactants and products of a chemical
reaction to be investigated by EVB simulation as two different
states or, for a multi-step reaction, one state for the products
of each elementary reaction step. In such a model of a reaction
bonds, angles, torsions, partial charges, vdW parameters etc. may
change for many atoms.

The idea behind this definition of different states is that Qdyn,
for each configuration of the system's particles, will keep track
of the energies of each state and write these to the energy file.
The mapping potential or sampling potential used to generate the
forces controlling the dynamics is a mixture of the FEP/EVB
states, determined by the mapping parameter or weight coefficient
$\lambda $ given to each (pure) state in the Qdyn input file. The
free energy differences between FEP/EVB states can then easily be
calculated by Qfep using the standard FEP formula or the potential
of mean force (umbrella sampling) approach to obtain the EVB
ground state reaction free energy profiles.

The FEP file has the same overall structure as the Qdyn input file
(see page \pageref{subsubsec:prep_qdyn_inp_f}) with various kinds
of data grouped into sections, the majority of which are optional.
We will describe FEP files for a couple of prototype cases,
starting with the simpler ones. For a complete description of the
file format, see FEP file format on page
\pageref{subsubsec:fepfileformat}.

\textbf{Example: Charging a benzene molecule}\\*[0.25cm] The FEP
file shown below may be used to calculate the electrostatic
contribution to the free energy of solvation for a benzene
molecule. The atoms and bonds of the molecule are defined in a
topology file (not shown). In our topology the carbon atoms have
odd numbers and hydrogens have even numbers.

\end{longtable}

The value following the keyword states in the section
[\textbf{FEP}] is the number of FEP/EVB states. In the
[\textbf{atoms}] sections atoms from the topology are designated
as q-atoms. The first column of the data records in this section
is the q-atom number given to the atom (used later to refer to it)
and the second column is the number of the atom in the topology.
The data in the section [\textbf{change{\_}charges}] defines the
charge of q-atoms in each state. Here we are changing the charges
of all atoms, but in general only the charges which change need to
be listed.

In the case above we have made no changes to the bonded or vdW
parameters of the benzene molecule and the FEP file is simply used
to define two "charge" states, one with the CH dipolar charges
being $\pm $0.15~e and one state with zero partial charges.

\textbf{Example: Changing van der Waals parameters}\\*[0.25cm] In
this example we will take a look at how to redefine van der Waals
(Lennard-Jones) interaction parameters. The FEP file shown below
may be used if we want to calculate the difference in hydration
free energy between two ions, in this case Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$.
Since the ions have the same charge the only change that needs to
be made in a perturbation calculation between the two ions is to
define two sets of Lennard-Jones interaction parameters.

\normalsize

Here we again define two states, but now only for one Q-atom that
has number 1 in our simple topology file which only contains the
single ion. No charges need to be changed since both ions are
monovalent cations, and the section [\textbf{change{\_}charges}]
is therefore omitted. The only specific definitions needed here
are the following. In the section [\textbf{atom{\_}types}] the
parameters for the atoms involved in the perturbation are given.
Whether (A$_{i}$, B$_{i})$ or (R$^{\ast }$, $\varepsilon )$ LJ
parameters are used depends on the combination rule specified in
the FF parameter file used to generate the topology. The first
column is the name of the Q-atom type, then follows the
Lennard-Jones A$_{i}$ (or R$^{\ast })$ and B$_{i}$ (or
$\varepsilon )$ parameters. Columns four to seven are not used in
this case (two parameters for the exponential repulsion function
and two LJ parameters for 1-4 interactions). The last column is
the atomic mass. The [\textbf{change{\_}atoms}] section states
that q-atom number one is of type Na in state 1 and type K in
state 2.

So, in this example all we have done is to define the relevant LJ
parameters for Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$ (Q-atom types for Na and K) as
the two different states for our single ion.

\textbf{Example: Valence bond (EVB) states for a proton transfer
reaction}\\*[0.25cm] This is an example from the reaction of a
protein tyrosine phosphatase where proton transfer from a Cys
residue of the enzyme to the doubly negatively charged phosphate
group of the substrate (phenylphosphate) is considered. The states
representing different bonding arrangements we want to define are
schematically drawn in figure \ref{fig:EVB-states}, where also the
topology number of the relevant atoms are given.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{10cm}{!}{\includegraphics*{\dirfig/EVB_states_2.pdf}}
\caption{EVB states for a proton transfer reaction.}
\label{fig:EVB-states}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The FEP file below describes the two EVB states used for
calculating the free energy profile of proton transfer in a
particular enzyme \cite{Kolmodin:}. It is beyond the scope here to
describe the EVB method in detail, but reviews on this topic are
available \cite{Aaqvist:1993}.

Here we want to define the first state with the proton (H)
attached to the sulphur atom of the cysteine and the phosphate
group doubly charged. In the second state the proton is on a
phosphate oxygen and one negative charge is now on the sulphur
atom. Here there are changes in both partial atomic charges, vdW
parameters, bonds, angles etc. between the two states.

In this example we define eight atoms as Q-atoms whose charges,
vdW parameters and bonding arrangement will change between the two
states (reactant and product state) that we describe by the FEP
file. The sections [\textbf{FEP}], [\textbf{atoms}],
[\textbf{change{\_}charges}], [\textbf{atom{\_}types}] and
[\textbf{change{\_}atoms}] are used as above, that is, we redefine
the charges and vdW parameters of the eight Q-atoms. $e.g.$, atom
no. 2, the sulphur, will change its charge from -0.45 to -1.00 and
its vdW parameters are changed from Q-atom type SH to S-. In this
model of the reaction we will also make use of a non-Lennard-Jones
non-bonded potential for certain pairs of atom that make and break
bonds as listed in the section [\textbf{soft{\_}pairs}]. For these
atoms, it is more physical to use an exponential function for the
repulsion than the normal 1/r$^{12}$ form which causes a too
strong repulsion at very short distances. The vdW interaction
between these pairs of atoms is given by:

\[
V_{soft} = C_{i}\cdot C_{j}\cdot e^{(-a_{i}\cdot a_{j}\cdot
r_{i,j})}
\]

where r$_{i,j}$ is the distance between the specific atom pair
subjected to this potential. The C's and a's are atom-type
specific parameters and the combination rule is geometric as can
be seen from the formula. Note the absence of the attractive
1/r$^{6}$ term.

Morse potential parameters for bonds that are broken or formed are
given in the [\textbf{bond{\_}types}] section. The section
[\textbf{change{\_}bonds}] lists the bonds, identified by pairs of
atoms and the bond parameters to use in each state. If a bond is
already defined in the topology then the normal, harmonic
potential will be turned off. The absence of a bond is specified
by setting the bond type to 0. Bond angles are redefined in an
analogous way, but the functional form of the Q-atom angles is
harmonic, like the normal angles. Parameters for the new angle
types are given under [\textbf{angle{\_}types}] and the angles for
which the new types should be used are listed in the
[\textbf{change{\_}angles}] section. Redefining torsions is done
in the same way (sections [\textbf{torsion{\_}types}] and
[\textbf{change{\_}torsions}]). No improper torsions are changed
in this example.

Angles, torsions and impropers depend on the existence of bonds
connecting the atoms defining the angle. Angles of all kinds can
therefore be coupled to bonds, in which case the angle energy will
be scaled by the ratio of the actual value of the Morse bond
energy to the dissociation energy \cite{Aaqvist:1991}. In the
example angle 6 (P{\-}O{\-}H ) is coupled to bond 3 (O{\-}H) and
angle 7 (CB{\-}S{\-}H) to bond 2 (S{\-}H), according to the
[\textbf{angle{\_}couplings}] section. Coupling torsions and
impropers (not in the example) work the same way.

Off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are defined in the
section [\textbf{off{\_}diagonals}]. They are represented by
H$_{i,j}$=A$_{i,j}\cdot e^{(-\mu _{i,j}\cdot \rm{r}_{k,l})}$ where
i and j are the two states involved and r$_{k,l}$ is the distance
between a specific pair of atoms k and l. The single record in
this example defines mixing of states 1 and 2 (H$_{1,2})$ for
q-atoms 2 and 8 with A=1.0 and $\mu $= 0.45.

\subsubsection{Monitoring non-bonded interactions}
In analysing the details of $e.g.$ receptor-ligand interactions, it
is useful to define some groups of atoms and calculate the
non-bonded interactions between pairs of atom groups. The example
FEP file below describes how to use this feature to get the
non-bonded energies between the pterinine ring of a dihydrofolate
reductase inhibitor and some amino acid side chains and an amide
group of a co-factor.

\begin{center}

  \hline 317  & 318  & 319  & 320  & 321  & 322  &      & !PHE 34 side chain \\

  \hline 1908 & 1909 & 1910 & 1911 & 1912 & 1913 & 1914 & !ring 2 of pterindine \\
  \hline 1880 & 1881 & 1882 & 1883 & 1884 & 1885 &      & !amide of NADPH \\
  \hline \multicolumn{7}{|l|}{[monitor{\_}group{\_}pairs]} & \\
  \hline 1 & 3 &&&&&&\\
  \hline 2 & 4 &&&&&&\\
  \hline 2 & 5 &&&&&&\\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Five groups of atoms are defined, and the interactions between
groups 1{\-}3, 2{\-}4 and 2{\-}5 should be calculated. The
energies are evaluated separately for different FEP states and
presented in the energy summaries in the Qdyn output. In this
example only a single state is defined so the $\lambda $-weighted
averages are identical to the energies in state 1.

========== Monitoring selected groups of nonbonded interactions ==========
\begin{tabbing}

\end{tabbing}

where the columns are: atom group pair number, total energy for
all states weighted by $\lambda $, weighted sum of electrostatic
energies, weighted sum of Lennard-Jones energies, electrostatic
energy in state 1, Lennard-Jones energy of state 1.

There is a similar feature in Qcalc (see page
\pageref{subsubsec:qcalc}) where one can analyze non-bonded
interactions from saved trajectory files.

\subsection{Parallel version of Q} Even though computers become
faster every year the work that a single computer can do is
limited. A single execution of Q will take hours or even days. If
a several computers were able to work in parallel with the same
job the execution time could be reduced substantially.

The most common way to run a parallel job is to use a computer
cluster in which every node has a separate processor and hard
drive. The nodes communicate through a fast network switch
providing an environment suitable for running parallel program. Q
has been parallelised to fit these type of machines.

The part of Q that can be run in parallel is Qdyn which contain
the time demanding conformational sampling. The parallel version
is suitable to run on 2 - 20 nodes depending on the size of the
problem and the speed of the network.

\subsubsection{Performance} To measure how well a parallel program
runs there are two quantities. The first one is the speed-up
defined as

\begin {equation}
S_p = \frac{\rm sequential\ time}{\rm parallel\ time} =
\frac{T^s_1}{T_p} \label{eq:speedup}
\end{equation}

where $T^s_1$ is the execution time for the best sequential
program and $T_p$ is the execution time for the parallel version
with $p$ processors. The absolute speedup gives a measure of the
improvement achieved by the parallelisation, \emph{i.e.} how many
times faster the parallel version is compared to the original.

The second quantity is the efficiency defined as

\begin {equation}
\eta = \frac{\rm sequential\ time}{P \times \rm parallel\ time} =
\frac{T_1^s}{P \times T_p} \label{eq:efficiency}
\end{equation}

where $P$ is the number of processors. The efficiency describes
how well the total cpu-time is utilised in the parallel version
compared to the sequential program.

The speed-up and efficiency of Q was measured using periodic
boundary condition for a molecular system with a ion-channel with
1550 atoms solvated by 4514 water molecules. Two series of
executions were made with two different cut-offs. The tests were
performed at a cluster with IBM SP2-nodes, 160 MHz.

The results of the test series can be seen in figure.
\ref{fig:speedup} and \ref{fig:efficiency}. The graphs show the
typical behaviour of a parallel program; the more nodes you use
the faster executions you get. But at the same time the nodes are
utilised less efficient. It is a trad-off between speed and
efficiency that is up to the user to decide. When the number of
simulations is close to the number of computers it is more
efficient to run sequentially; performing 15 simulations on 15
computers is best done by assigning one job per node.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics*[scale=0.6]{\dirfig/efficiency.pdf}
\caption{Efficiency of the nodes when running Qdyn in parallel.
The efficiency decreases as the number of nodes increase due to
more communication and longer summation of the forces.}
\label{fig:efficiency}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Running Q on a cluster} Q version 5.0 and higher can
be run in parallel on clusters. The parallel version is easy to
use. The only requirement is a computer cluster with high
bandwidth and a version of Message Passing Interface (MPI)
installed. MPI is a standard interface for communication between
nodes in a cluster. To run Q on the cluster you need the parallel
version of Q, \emph{i.e.} the one that has been compiled with the
MPI-flag activated. If you compile the program yourself define the
variable USE\_MPI to the preprocessor. To check that you have the
right version execute the program and confirm that the suffix
"\_parallel" is added to the version info in the log file. Look at
the top of the file where it should read "Qdyn version
X.XX\_parallel initialising....". The parallel version can be
executed on a single node but still requires MPI installed.

When submitting jobs to a cluster Q will automatically detect how
many nodes that are available. Thus no special input to Q is
required about how many nodes are being used. Make sure you run on
dedicated nodes, \emph{i.e.} you have exclusive access to the
nodes, and that no other job is running on the nodes. If the nodes
are not dedicated entirely to Q the parallel execution become
meaningless as a result of the synchronisation between the nodes
in each time step. Consult your system administrator on how to
commit jobs to a specified number of dedicated nodes.

\subsection{Analysis of results}

\subsubsection{Analysing structures from the simulation}
\label{subsubsec:Analysing_struc_f_t_sim} Qprep is also used after
the simulation to convert the binary trajectory and restart
coordinate files generated by Qdyn to PDB or mol2 files suitable
for viewing in a molecular graphics program.

\textbf{Making PDB or mol2 files from restart or trajectory
files}\\*[0.25cm] Use the following steps to generate viewable
files from individual
"snapshot" structures: \\

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Load the topology file using the \textbf{readtop} command. The fragment
library files used to generate the topology will be loaded
automatically, if available. Otherwise load the libraries using
\textbf{readlib}.
\item[2a.] Load the binary coordinate file using \textbf{readx}.
\item[2b.] Open a trajectory file with the \textbf{trajectory} command. You
will be prompted if you want to use the atom mask from the
trajectory so that only atoms in the trajectory will appear in
structure files written. Read coordinates from the trajectory file
with \textbf{readframe}
\item[3.] If you want to select specific atoms to
include in the structure files to be written, use the
\textbf{mask} command . First enter mask none to clear the current
mask, then add atoms to the mask using the syntax described in the
section Atom mask on page \pageref{subsubsec:atom_masks}.
\item[4a.] Write a PDB file using the \textbf{writepdb} command. It may be written
with or without gap markers.
\item[4b.] Write a mol2 file using the \textbf{writemol2} command.
\item[5.] Repeat steps 2 and 4 to convert more
files. To read the next frame from a trajectory use the
\textbf{readnext} command and then go to step 4. Note that CONECT
records in PDB files (defining atomic connectivity) will only be
generated for fragments whose library entries include PDBtype
HETATM in their info section.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Trajectory animation}\\*[0.25cm] There are a number of
programs for visualising and analysing MD trajectories, $e.g.$
Visual Molecular Dynamics, VMD \cite{VMD, VMD_homepage} and
gOpenMol \cite{gOM, gOM_homepage} which can read the DCD format
trajectories generated by Qdyn. To create a PDB file with the same
set of atoms as in the trajectory, as required by the
visualisation programs,
execute the steps below in Qprep:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Load the topology file using the \textbf{readtop} command. The
fragment library files used to generate the topology will be
loaded automatically, if available. Otherwise load the libraries
using \textbf{readlib}.
\item[2.] Open a trajectory file with the \textbf{trajectory}
command. You want to use the atom mask from the trajectory (answer
y for yes at the prompt).
\item[3.] If you want to use another
coordinate set than that of the topology for your PDB file, use
\textbf{readframe} or \textbf{readx} as described above.
\item[4.] Write a PDB file using the \textbf{writepdb} command. Don't include gap
markers.

\subsubsection{Free energy calculation using Qfep} Performing free
energy perturbation (FEP) calculations with Q involves running a
set of consecutive input files which have the mapping parameter
vector $\lambda$ ranging in a desired way (usually [1, 0] to [0,
1] for two states). Qfep is a program which reads the energy files
generated by Qdyn and calculates the total change in free energy
for the complete perturbation from state A ($\varepsilon_1$) to
state B ($\varepsilon_2$). The difference in free energy between
the two states is calculated by Zwanzig's formula:

\begin {equation}
\label{eq:zwanzig} \Delta G = \sum{ \Delta g} = \sum{ -R \cdot T
\cdot \ln \left \langle e^{- \left ( \frac{\Delta V_{eff}}{R \cdot
T}\right )} \right \rangle_A}
\end{equation}

where V$_{eff}= \lambda_1 \cdot \varepsilon_1 + \lambda_2 \cdot
\epsilon_2 \, , \, \Sigma \lambda_n = 1$. $\Delta $V$_{eff}$ is
the difference in V$_{eff}$ between two adjacent perturbation
steps.

\begin{table}
\caption{Qfep input file for FEP/EVB evaluation}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|X|}
\hline \textbf{Line}& \textbf{Data}& \textbf{Description} \\
\hline 1  & 11            & Number of energy files \\
\hline 2  & 2 0           & Number of states, number of predefined off-diagonal elements (from .fep-file, 0 means redefine) \\

\hline {\ldots}19& md{\_}10.ene& \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The program returns a list containing average energies and lambda
values for each file. After that, the free energy change between
each perturbation step (file) is summarised. The change is
calculated relative to both the previous and the following
perturbation step (dGf and dGr for forward and reverse way
respectively). The accumulated sum of the energy changes between
$\varepsilon_{1}$ to $\varepsilon_{2}$ is also given (sum(dGf) and
sum(dGr)), as well as the average accumulated change calculated
from the forward and reverse way $\langle$dG$\rangle$.

Qfep also calculates free energy functions, or potentials of mean
force, by the perturbation formula:

\begin {equation}
\Delta G(X_m) = \Delta G(\lambda_i) - R\cdot T\cdot \ln
\left\langle {e^{- \left( \frac{E_g (X_m)- V_i (X_m)}{R\cdot
T}\right)}} \right\rangle_i
\end{equation}

The reaction coordinate X is defined as the energy gap between the
states X = $\Delta$V = $\varepsilon_1 - \varepsilon_2$ and is
divided into intervals X$_{m}$ (bins). The first term in the above
equation represents the free energy difference between the initial
state $\varepsilon_{1}$ and the mapping potential V$_{i}$:

\begin {equation}
\Delta G\left( \lambda_i \right) = - R\cdot T\cdot \ln \sum
\limits_{n=0}^{i-1} {\left\langle e^{- \left( \frac{V_{n+1} -V_n
}{R\cdot T}\right)} \right\rangle _n }
\end{equation}

The second term represents the free energy difference between the
mapping potential V$_{i}$ and the ground state potential E$_{g}$.
The MD average in this term is only taken over those
configurations where X belongs to X$_{m}$. E$_{g}$ is the solution
to the secular determinant:

\begin {equation}
\label{secular_determinant} \left| {{\begin{array}{*{20}c}
 {\varepsilon _1 - E_g } \hfill & \cdots \hfill & H_{1n} \hfill \\
 \vdots \hfill & \ddots \hfill & \vdots \hfill \\
 H_{n1} \hfill & \cdots \hfill & {\varepsilon _n - E_g } \hfill \\
\end{array} }} \right|=0
\end{equation}


For a two-state representation the solution becomes:

\begin {equation}
\label{two_state} E_g =\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \left(
{\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2 } \right) -
\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \sqrt {\left( \varepsilon_1 +
\varepsilon_2 \right)^2 + 4\cdot H^2_{12}}
\end{equation}

H$_{ij}$ is the off-diagonal matrix element representing the
quantum mechanical coupling of the states. This coupling is zero
for normal FEP calculations. H$_{ij} \ne $ 0 results in mixing of
states i and j, which is desired when calculating reaction free
energy profiles for reactions represented by the empirical valence
bond (EVB) model. In Qfep the off-diagonal element is a function
of the form:

\begin {equation}
H_{ij}=A_{ij}\cdot (e^{-(\mu (r_{ij}-r_{0}) + \eta
(r_{ij}-r_{0})^{2})})
\end {equation}

where r$_{ij}$ is the measured distance between the reacting
atoms. By choosing $\mu $ and $\eta $ differently, H$_{ij}$ can
either be a constant, an exponential function or a gaussian
function.

The EVB method allows calibration of simulated reference reactions
to experimental data obtained from gas-phase or solution
experiments. The two EVB parameters H$_{ij}$ (mostly A$_{ij})$ and
$\Delta \alpha _{ij}$ are varied until the calculated profile and
the experimental data coincide. $\Delta \alpha _{ij}$ is a
constant energy shift between the states that represents their
difference in heat of formation, which is not included in the
force field. Generalised, the $\Delta \alpha _{ij}$ parameter
determines the $\Delta $G$^{\circ}$ level and H$_{ij}$ regulates
the degree of mixing of the states at the transition state $i.e.$
the $\Delta$G$^{\ddag }$ level.

The energies describing the FEP functions and the reaction free
energy profile are summarised in the last table generated by Qfep.
Note that each bin has contributions from several different values
of $\lambda$. Likewise, each value of $\lambda$ contributes to the
sampling of several different bins.

It is possible to handle more than two valence bond states in Qdyn
and Qfep, however sampling and calibration may be a difficult task
for more than two states.

\subsubsection{Reaction free energy averaging using avefep}

In the reaction free energy calculations described above, several
mapping potentials (different $\lambda$'s) will sample each
interval X$_{m}$. The resulting values for the potential of mean
force have to be averaged to obtain the final values of $\Delta $G
associated with each interval X$_{m}$. Avefep calculates the
average values (weighted by sample size) of $\Delta$G
corresponding to each interval from Qfep output data.

Input is an output-file created by Qfep.

Output is a table with the average $\Delta$G corresponding to the
reaction co-ordinate X.

\hline 3               &   Average $\Delta$G \\
\hline 4               &   Average $\Delta$G, lowest point at 0. \\
\hline 5               &   Number of points in bin \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:avefep}
\end{center}
\end{table}


Usage: perl avefep.pl $<$ qfep.out $>$ avefep.out

\subsubsection{Simple energy averaging using Qave}
Qave calculates average energies and RMS deviations from
.log-files. The program uses one line of input:

perl Qave.pl \textit{[-s nskip]} files

The value \textit{nskip} is the number of steps to be discarded at
the beginning of the log-file. Default is zero. A number of
log-files can be listed after one another and the average energies
calculated from all files will be returned.

\subsubsection{Trajectory averaging using Qavetr}
Average structures from trajectory files are generated by the
program Qavetr. Execute the program by typing:

Qavetr

The program will ask for the trajectory file to be processed. More
than one trajectory file may be used in the averaging. Enter the
files one at a time and end with a blank line. Enter the name of
the output file that will contain the coordinates of the average
structure. The output file is binary but can be converted to a
pdb-file by using the program Qprep. Root mean
square coordinate deviation is given in {\AA}.

\subsection{Scoring}\label{subsection:scoring}
Three scoring functions are implemented in QCalc: X-Score\cite{Wang:2002}, ChemScore\cite{Eldridge:1997} and PMF-Score\cite{Muegge:1999}. X-Score and ChemScore are empiricial whilst PMF-Score is knowledge based.

All scoring functions require the topology to be loaded and the correct mask be specified. The initial topology (with coordinates from the .top-file) can be scored to verify atom typing.

Both trajectory and restart files can be scored. The following options are avaliable in QCalc when specifying trajectory or restart files:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{adding \emph{,frames=every n} means calculations will only be performed on every $n$:th
frame.}
  \item{adding \emph{,frames=n-m} means calculations will only be performed on frames $n$ to $m$.}
  \item{specifying \emph{mean} instead of a file name calculates the mean of all frames processed since start or since the last time ''mean" was specified.}
\end{itemize}

The input requested is similar for all three functions. To avoid confusion, examples of typical inputs will be given.

\subsubsection{X-Score}

\paragraph{Input}
  Example input is presented below.

      Enter names of coordinate or restart files & c:/peter/data/.../md.dcd,frames=every 5                                \\
                                   &  mean                                \\
      \hline
        & \\
    \end{tabular}
    %\caption{Example of X-Score input.}
    \label{xinput}
  \end{minipage}

    \subparagraph{Cofactors}
    X-Score uses different typing schemes to assign atoms types to protein and ligands atoms. If needed, atoms in parts of the protein can be typed using the ligand atom-typing procedure by defining a cofactor. This is useful if the protein has some special residue, like HEM in P450, that is not defined in the X-Score residue library (file RESIDUE\_DEF\_XTOOL.dat). Ligand atoms are typed on the individual atom level, in contrast to the residue level for protein atoms, using data in file ATOM\_DEF\_XTOOL.dat.
    Cofactor definitions are made on separate lines and has the form: restype=RES, where RES is the residue name, e.g. HEM. All atoms, regardless of their proximity to each other, in residues named RES will be included in the cofactor RES and typed as if they were ligand atoms (though in every other respect they are considered as part of the protein). Any number of cofactors can be defined.

    \subparagraph{Force field}
    A force field translation key has to be given to allow for the translation of atom types according to the Q convention to types according to the Sybyl convention. The translation tables are in the file ATOM\_TYPE\_CONVERSIONS.dat (shared with PMF-Score). A different translation file can be specified in the input file (see below).

    \subparagraph{Parameters}
    Scoring parameters, output specifications and data files are specified in an input file. Default parameters can be used by specifying \emph{default} when asked for scoring parameters. In that case the following parameters and filenames are used:

    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    SHOW\_ABS      & 'NO'  &          ! Show binding score for each atom? \\
    SHOW\_TOTAL    & 'YES' &          ! Show total binding score? \\
    SHOW\_LIGAND   & 'YES' &          ! Show ligand atoms? \\
    SHOW\_PROTEIN  & 'NO'  &          ! Show protein atoms? \\
    SHOW\_COFACTOR & 'YES' &          ! Show cofactor atoms? \\

    APPLY\_HPSCORE & 'YES' &          ! Use hydrophobic contact algorithm? \\
    APPLY\_HMSCORE & 'YES' &          ! Use hydrophobic matching algorithm? \\
    APPLY\_HSSCORE & 'YES' &          ! Use hydrophobic surface algorithm? \\
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    RESIDUE\_DEFINITIONS &   residue\_def\_xtool.dat      \\
    ATOM\_DEFINITIONS    &   atom\_def\_xtool.dat         \\
    LOGP\_DEFINITIONS    &   atom\_def\_xlogp.dat         \\
    SURFACE\_DEFINITIONS &   surface\_def\_xtool.dat      \\
    ATOM\_TRANSLATIONS   &   atom\_type\_conversions.dat  \\
    \end{tabular}

    Applying more than one hydrophobic algorithm results in a consensus score. Default scoring coefficients are as reported in \cite{Wang:2002}.

  \paragraph{Output}
  When SHOW\_LIGAND and/or SHOW\_PROTEIN is specified, a list of ligand and/or protein atoms is displayed, showing the atom type, residue, atomic properties, neighbouring atoms and bonds for each atom. In  addition, a list of bonds and aromatic rings detected are output.

  When scoring, the contribution from each term (van der Waals (VDW), H-bonding (HB), hydrophobic contact (HP), matching (HM) and surface (HS) and rotational(RT)) is displayed along with the total score. If SHOW\_ABS was specified the contributions for every ligand atom is displayed.
  Atomic binding score is always displayed when scoring the initial configuration.

  X-Score results are in $pK_d$ units.

  \paragraph{Data files}
  The format of the data files is further explained in the respective files.


\subsubsection{ChemScore}

\paragraph{Input}
  Example input is presented below.

  \begin{minipage}[t]{1.0\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      Prompt                        & Input     \\
      \hline
      Topology file:                & c:/peter/data/P450/adm/adm.top  \\

      Parameter file:                  & c:/peter/data/ff/chemscore\_oplsaa.prm \\
      Qcalc$>$                         & go                                   \\
      Enter names of coordinate or restart files & c:/peter/data/.../md.dcd,frames=every 5                                \\
                                   &  mean                                \\
      \hline
        & \\
    \end{tabular}
    \label{xinput}
  \end{minipage}

  \subparagraph{Parameter file}
  ChemScore reads all atom parameters from a single parameter file, though there are different files for different force fields. The parameter file defines the atomic properties of all atom types.

  \paragraph{Output}
  Prior to scoring, ChemScore outputs atom type and bond information for all ligand atoms, as well as information about rings detected. For every frame, the contribution from each term (H-bonds, metal contacts, lipophilic contacts and frozen rotatable bonds) is displayed along with the total score.

  ChemScore results are in kJ/mol. A negative score means negative energy.

 \subsubsection{PMF-Score}
 \paragraph{Input}
   Example input is presented below.

   \begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      Prompt                        & Input     \\

      Mask                          & .         \\

      Score initial topology? (yes/no) & yes                                  \\
      Q-atom (FEP) file:               & c:/peter/data/P450/adm/lig.fep  \\
      Force field translation key:  & qoplsaa \\
      Scoring parameters:           & pmfscore\_default.input \\
      Qcalc$>$                         & go                                   \\
      Enter names of coordinate or restart files & c:/peter/data/.../md.dcd,frames=every 5 \\
                                   &  mean                                \\
      \hline
        & \\
    \end{tabular}
    \label{xinput}
  \end{minipage}

  Presently, all atoms defined as solvent atoms are ignored. Critical water molecules should be defined as part of the protein or they will be excluded.

  \subparagraph{Force field}
  As for X-Score, a force field translation key has to be given to allow for the translation of Q atom types to Sybyl atom types. The Sybyl type derived is only used to determine the hybridization of carbon and nitrogen atoms.

  \subparagraph{Scoring parameters}
  Output options, data files and the maximum ring size considered are defined in an input file. The output options are similar to those in X-Score. The maximum ring size parameter determines the number of steps the ring finding algorithm will take in every search direction. Too low a setting will prevent the algorithm from finding all rings. Too high a setting will increase the time required for the ring search.

  \paragraph{Output}
  When SHOW\_LIGAND and/or SHOW\_PROTEIN is specified, a list of ligand and/or protein atoms is displayed, showing the atom type, residue, atomic properties, neighbouring atoms and bonds for each atom. In addition, a list of rings detected are output. If specified, bonds are also output.
  Atomic binding score is displayed only when scoring the initial configuration (topology).

  It is safe to consider PMF-Score results as rankings where a more negative score means better binding. For details about converting PMF-Score to free energy of binding, see \cite{Muegge:1999}.

\subsection{Useful tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item To run FEP simulations of a ligand in water and bound to a
protein using the same FEP file, use the \textbf{offset{\_}name}
keyword in the [\textbf{FEP}] section of the FEP file to instead
of renumbering all the atoms!
\item Make a separate library file for your new molecules
and leave the amino acid library unchanged. Load both library
files in Qprep!
\item It is possible to add parameters to the parameter
file without restarting Qprep. Just type maketop and the updated
file will be used!
\item For FEP simulations involving dummy
atoms, the daring user might consider ignoring some Qprep warnings
about missing parameters all of those interactions are to be
redefined in a FEP file. It is possible, but in general not
advisable, to write a topology file with missing parameters and to
use it in Qdyn.
\item Use build rules in your fragment library entries to control the
positioning of hydrogens.
\item Improve scoring accuracy by averaging over e.g. every 10:th frame
of a short equilibration trajectory file!
\end{itemize}


\section{TUTORIALS}
\subsection{Binding affinity from LIE simulations}
The example here is the binding of stearate to a muscular
fatty-acid binding protein. We have used the Q version of the
GROMOS87 forcefield for the simulations.

\subsubsection{Editing the PDB file}
The structure of the M-FABP complex with stearate, PDB-idcode 1HMT
was downloaded. The PDB-file needs some editing before use, first
you have to remove some of the crystal waters, if any. In the
1HMT-file, 17 waters were saved, having an important role in the
binding with the ligand or in other interactions. To decide which
waters to save, pick an atom in the ligand to be the centre of
your system and choose how large simulation sphere you are going
to use. Here, a sphere of 18.0 {\AA} radius has been used. Then
keep the waters inside the sphere that seem to bee involved in any
interactions and that lie inside the protein. We have deleted the
waters by hand in a molecular viewer program and then saving only
the lines holding the coordinates. The part left from the original
pdb-file is the coordinates of the protein, ligand and some
waters. But it takes some more editing. All lines that are blank
or say TER also have to be removed. There has to be a line saying
GAP between the different molecules. All the cysteines that are
connected through sulphur bridges should be renamed CSS.

Note also that hydrogen atoms need not to be present in the PDB
file, they will be added by the Qprep program.

\subsubsection{Modelling ionic groups of the protein}
Be aware that the default model of the charged amino acid residues
(ASP, GLU, ARG, LYS) in the Q-GROMOS87 fragment library have the
protonation state of the ionic form, but the net charge replaced
by a dipole similar to that of neutral form. The corresponding
charged side chains are described by library entries AS-, GL-, AR+
and LY+, respectively. Below, we refer to the process of renaming
\emph{e.g.} an ASP residue to AS- as "turning on" the charge of
that side chain.

Now it is time to decide which of the charged amino acids that
should be "turned on". You can use the same rules here as in
choosing which waters to keep. Amino acids near the ligand,
creating an salt bridge or interacting in any other way in the
function of the protein and which lie inside the 18.0 {\AA} sphere
should be charged. Residues closer than about 3-5 {\AA} from the
boundary should be neutral unless they form an ion pair with a
more central group. In a case like this, when the ligand has an
ionic group, is it important to make the protein net neutral. In
this example, amino acids 17, 72, 76, 77, 78, 106 and 126 were
charged. This is most easily done in the program proq (see page
\pageref{subsubsec:proq}). After loading your pdb-file
(\textit{load} filename.pdb), one good thing to do is make a
subset centre (\textit{centre} name coordinates), of the centre
atom you chose before. From this subset, you can measure distances
to different residues (\textit{dist} subset subset), like the ones
you want to charge, and the water molecules. You turn on the amino
acid charges by the command on followed by the residue number
(\textit{on} nr). Remember to save the new pdb-file before exiting
proq (\textit{save} filename.pdb). There are many other useful
functions in the proq program, type \textit{help }and you will get
a list of them.

\subsubsection{Writing the library file}
The next step is to write a library file for the ligand. This is
easiest done by editing an old library file. You can also get a
lot of help from looking at the amino acid library file
(\textit{e.g.} Qgrm87.lib). In the lib file, all the atoms of the
ligand, the bonds and the charge groups are listed. For each atom,
you need to specify name, type and charge. Make sure the charges
in the complex file add up to the charge of the ligand file. All
the different types of atoms are listed in the parameter file
(Qgrm87j.prm). For the charges, one can sometimes compare with an
amino acid from the amino acid library file. For stearate, the lib
file is stearate.lib. Also make sure you name the atoms the same
way as in the pdb file. Since the ligand will not be connected to
any other fragment, the head and tail connections can be omitted.

You also need a pdb file for the ligand, copy the relevant lines
from the PDB file of the complex to a separate file.

\subsubsection{Qprep}
Now it is time to make the topology files. They contain all the
information about the system and are used in the Qdyn simulation.
This is done in Qprep, where the sulphur bridges also are created.
You have to make two topology files, one for the ligand in protein
simulation and one for the ligand without the protein simulation.
In Qprep, you start by reading the library files and the pdb files
(\textit{readlib }filename.lib, \textit{readpdb }filename.pdb). In
the ligand-protein topology, both the amino acid library and the
ligand library files has to be read, and the sulphur bridges
created. This is done by the command addbond. (\textit{addbond
}atomnumber atomnumber). For the atom numbers of the sulphurs, you
can list the atoms in the cysteins (\textit{listres
}residuenumber). Note that you cannot use the numbers from the PDB
file since atoms will be renumbered as hydrogens are added. After
this you select boundary and solvate the system. Then it is time
to create the topology, \textit{maketop}. If there are any
parameters missing, Qprep will tell you here. To create new
parameters, edit the parameter file in a way that you can see the
changes made. You can always write comments in the file after a
"!". After saving the modified parameter file, all you need to do
is \textit{maketop }again. To write the topology file, use the
command \textit{writetop.}

There are many other useful applications to Qprep, among other
things you can list the high energy bonds, angles, torsions and
impropers by the commands \textit{checkbond }energylevel,
\textit{checkangs }energylevel and so on. If you get a too high
bond, angle or torsion energy, perhaps you have connected the
sulphur bridges wrongly or forgotten a GAP between two molecules.
If an improper has a very high energy, it might have the wrong
sign (e.q. 180 instead of -180 degrees), use the command changeimp
to redefine them automatically (\textit{changeimp} 2 energylevel).
After using changeimp, you need to write the topology again. You
may also want to make a new PDB file, use \textit{writepdb, }with
atoms renumbered and hydrogens added. By typing \textit{help},
Qprep lists all the commands with a small explanation.

\subsubsection{FEP files}
In this example the only thing specified in the FEP files are the
Q-atoms, that is, the ligand. In the simulation without the
protein, this is simply all the atoms, but in the protein-ligand
simulation, you have to find the atom numbers of the ligand in the
new pdb file. There are a lot of other things that can be
specified in the FEP file, but none of those functions are used in
this example.

\subsubsection{Creating input files}
The input file controls the simulation in Qdyn. It contains
information on how many steps, how long steps, what temperature,
which topology to use and a lot of other things. In this example,
the data collection phase was split into five identical,
consecutive steps to make it easier to restart after an
interruption. This gives five input files to each of the two
simulations and another 6 for the equilibration of the
ligand-protein complex. An input file is easiest created by
editing an old input file. The things that need to be specified to
a specific simulation are the centre of the simulation sphere and
water sphere, the topology- and FEP files, and restraints. The
coordinates of the water- and simulation sphere should be the
same, coming from the atom in the ligand that you picked earlier.

In this example, the equilibration warms up the system, starting
with 0 degrees gradually raising the temperature to 300 degrees.
All the heavy atoms, including those of the ligand, are restrained
during this equilibration. When the system is equilibrated, 5x50
000 simulation steps of 1 fs are taken for both of the
simulations. All the files except the initial one are restarted
from the coordinates and velocities of the previous step. When a
new temperature is given, you also need to give a random seed.
When the temperature is the same as in the previous file, set the
random seed to zero.

The coordinates of the water sphere must be specified in the first
input file. In this example, a co-ordinate file with randomly
oriented water molecules on a grid, was used.

\subsubsection{Using Qdyn}
To start the simulation, write: Qdyn filename.inp $>$
filename.log, to use a specific input file and write the output to
a log file. When many input files are used it is much easier to
write all the commands to a command file and then run that.

\subsubsection{Evaluating the simulation}
By using the script lsextr (\textit{lsextr} md0*.log $>$
filename.txt), the van der Waals and electrostatic energies are
respectively extracted from the log files. It is a good idea to
plot these energies, \textit{e.g.} by using gnuplot, to see if
there are any large changes in the energies throughout the
simulation, see figure \ref{fig:tutorial_energies}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[width=5.92in,height=3.45in]{\dirfig/tutorial_energies.pdf}}
\caption{Energies} \label{fig:tutorial_energies}
\end{figure}

Viewing the structures after the different parts of the simulation
is a very important part of the evaluation of the simulations. To
make pdb files of the restart files use Qprep. Read the topology
file, then read the restart file (\textit{readx }md0{\#}.re) and
write the new pdb file.

To get averages of the different energies, a program called tstart
(\textit{tstart~}{\-}q~filename.txt~{\#}~{\#}~{\#}), was used.
Tstart calculates the overall average and also an average where
you can split the energies in two, each giving the same average,
skipping the first values. The numbers in the command are
different choices you can make where the first is either 1 or 2,
van der Waal or electrostatic energies. With the second you can
choose where to start, zero meaning the beginning, the third how
many rows to read, zero meaning all.

The next thing to do is to calculate the electrostatic free energy
contribution from the ligand's interaction with ionic groups of
the protein that were neglected (not "turned on") during the
simulation. We approximate this free energy using Coulomb's law
with $\varepsilon$ = 80. Run proq, load the pdb file and read the
ligand library used in Qprep. The command onoff (\textit{onoff}
{\#}-{\#}{\#}) switches the charges, charging the uncharged and
neutralising the charged. Then calculate the electrostatic energy,
$\Delta $G$_{onoff}$, (\textit{repel} ligand \textit{charged}).
This energy should be small, less than 1 kcal/mol. If not, some
amino acids that should be turned on probably were not.

Then you can calculate the binding free energy, using the LIE
formula:

\begin {equation}
\label{eq:LIE} \Delta G_{bind} = \alpha \left( {\left\langle
{V_{l-s}^{LJ}} \right\rangle_{bound} - \left\langle {V_{l-s}^{LJ}}
\right\rangle_{free}} \right) + \beta\left( {\left\langle
{V_{l-s}^{el}} \right\rangle_{bound} - \left\langle {V_{l-s}^{el}}
\right\rangle_{free}} \right) + \Delta G_{onoff}
\end{equation}

In this example, we use $\beta $ = 0.5 (no deviations from
electrostatic linear response for a charged ligand) and $\alpha $
= 0.181 (from previous calibration using GROMOS87). This gives a
$\Delta $G$_{bind}$ = -8.0 kcal/mol, which is close to the
experimentally determined value of $\Delta $G$_{bind}$ = -7.9
kcal/mol.

The $\beta $-value varies with the number of OH - groups on the
ligand, when using GROMOS87 for ligands with no ionic groups,
$\beta $ should be selected from a set of values accordingly to
the composition of the ligand (number of
OH-groups).\cite{Hansson:1998}


\section{REFERENCE GUIDE}
\subsection{Program modules}
Q is build from Fortran90 modules, which are combined in different
sets in the Q programs, as shown in figure \ref{fig:modules}. This
makes it easier to maintain the software. It also makes it rather
straight-forward for users with experience in programming to
create their own special-purpose programs by re-using $e.g.$ the
trajectory and topology modules.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.9]{\dirfig/modules.pdf}}
\caption{The modules that build up Q.} \label{fig:modules}
\end{figure}

The figure does not show the dependence of some modules on others.

\subsection{Force field reference information}
Q is not associated with any particular force field. The force
fields are defined in parameter files, separate from the program
and the choice of force field is thus simply a matter of which
parameter file to use. Any force field could be used with the
program, as long as it shares the common functional form of eq.
\ref{eq:V_pot}.

\begin{multline}
\label{eq:V_pot}
 V_{pot} =\sum\limits_{bonds} {\frac{1}{2}k_b \cdot \left( {r-r_0
} \right)^2} +\sum\limits_{angles} {\frac{1}{2}k_\theta \left(
{\theta -\theta_0} \right)^2} +\sum\limits_{dihedrals} {K_\varphi
\cdot \left( {1+\cos \left( {n\cdot \varphi -\delta } \right)}
\right)} \\
  +\sum\limits_{\substack{improper \\ dihedrals}}
{\frac{1}{2}k_\xi \left( {\xi -\xi _0} \right)^2}
+\sum\limits_{\substack{atom \\ pairs \; i , \, j}}
{\frac{1}{4\cdot \pi \cdot \varepsilon_0 } \cdot q_i \cdot q_j
\cdot r_{ij}^{-1} +A_{ij} \cdot r_{ij}^{-12} -B_{ij} \cdot
r_{ij}^{-6}}
\end{multline}

where V$_{pot}$ is the total potential energy, $k_{b}$ is a bond
stretching force constant, $r$ is the distance between two bonded
atoms, $r_{0}$ is the reference bond length, $k_{\theta }$ is an
angle bending force constant, $\theta$  the angle between two
bonds, $\theta _{0}$ is the reference angle, $k_{\varphi }$ is a
force constant for rotation around a dihedral angle, $n$ is the
multiplicity (number of minima per full turn) of the dihedral
angle $\varphi$, $\delta$  is the phase shift ($\delta$/\emph{n}
gives the location of first maximum), $k_{\xi }$ is an
out-of-plane bending force constant for the improper dihedral
angle $\xi$ with reference angle $\xi_{0}$, $q_{i}$ and $q_{j}$
are the partial charges of atoms $i$ and $j$ separated by the
distance $r_{ij}$. A$_{ij}$ and B$_{ij}$ are the geometric
Lennard-Jones parameters for the interaction between atoms $i$ and
$j$. The Lennard-Jones parameters are defined per atom type as
A$_{i}$ and B$_{i}$ and are combined using either of the two
standard rules to determine the effective interaction parameters.
The geometric rule is simply: A$_{ij}= \:$A$_{i}\cdot $A$_{j}$ and
B$_{ij}=\:$B$_{i}\cdot $B$_{j}$ where A$_{i}=\:$A$_{ii}^{1/2}$ and
B$_{i}=\:$B$_{ii}^{1/2}$. Some force fields use the form:\\

$\varepsilon_{ij} \cdot \left( {\left( {\frac{R_{ij}^\ast
}{r_{ij}}} \right)^{12}-2\cdot \left( {\frac{R_{ij}^\ast
}{r_{ij}}} \right)^6} \right)$\\

for the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential. In this case the atom
type-parameters $\varepsilon _{i}$, $\varepsilon _{j}$,
R$^{\ast}_{i}$ and R$^{\ast }_{j}$ are combined using the rules:
$\varepsilon _{ij}=(\varepsilon _{i}\cdot \varepsilon
_{j})^{1/2}$and R$^{\ast}_{ij} = $R$^{\ast}_{i}$+R$^{\ast}_{j}$.
Several Fourier components of the dihedral terms, with different
K$_{\varphi }$, n and $\delta $, can be added for the same
dihedral angle to allow a more accurate modelling of the barriers
for rotation. An alternative form of the improper dihedral
potential using trigonometric functions just as for normal
dihedrals is also implemented.

The molecular fragments, $e.g.$ amino acid residues, defined in the
force fields are divided into charge groups which are groups of
atoms whose partial charges add up to an integer. Cut-off of
non-bonded interactions is then done based on these groups, $i.e.$
either all pairwise interactions between the two groups are
evaluated, or none. The average size of the charge groups varies
between force fields, from a few atoms to entire residues. Some
force fields designate a "switching centre" in each charge group
and performs cut-off only based on the distance between the
switching centres, while others include all interactions between
two groups if any pair of atoms is within the cut-off radius.

Some properties of the force fields available for Q are given in
table \ref{tab:FF}. Please note that these are our translations of
the force field and we cannot guarantee 100\% identity with the
original.

\subsection{Topology preparation reference}\label{subsec:top_prep_ref}
\subsubsection{Coordinate files for input into Qprep}
Atomic coordinates are entered into Qprep as PDB files. The PBD
file must conform to some rules to be accepted by Qprep (if not
specified use the PDB standard):

\begin{itemize}
\item Qprep will only accept and read ATOM and HETATM records. All other record types have to be removed.
\item Residue numbers must be numeric, $i.e.$ alphanumeric residue identifiers like 60B are not allowed. Use the renumber script to renumber residues. The numbering does not have to start at 1, but Qprep will renumber residues starting at 1.
\item Molecules must be separated with a gap marker line. This line should contain only the word GAP in capital letters, optionally preceded by blanks or tabs. There should not be a gap marker at the end of the file.
\item Atom numbering is not significant and Qprep will renumber atoms starting from 1. Note that the numbering will change due to the insertion of hydrogen atoms.
\item Only upper case letters may be used in PDB files.
\item Residue names must match fragment library entry names. The maximal length of residue names is 3 alphanumeric characters (position 13 to 16). Most other characters like +, -, {\_} are also permitted.
\item Atom names must match atom names within the relevant fragment library entry.
\item Temperature factors and occupancy numbers are ignored by Qprep and are optional.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Atom masks}\label{subsubsec:atom_masks}
An atom mask defines a subset of atoms and is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item in Qprep to select which atoms are included when writing
structure files (PDB and mol2)
\item in Qdyn to select which atoms
to include in the trajectory and
\item in Qcalc to select atoms
for superposition and coordinate deviation calculations.
\end{itemize}
The atom mask is constructed by selecting atoms within a sequence
that match a set of properties. The properties that can be
selected are:

\begin{itemize}
\item solute: all atoms except solvent atoms
\item heavy: all atoms except hydrogens (atoms with mass $\ge$ 4 mass units to be precise)
\item excluded: atoms outside the simulation sphere including excluded solvent molecules
\item restrained: atoms in the restrained boundary zone and atoms outside the sphere
\end{itemize}

Each property can be negated by putting `not' before it. Multiple
properties on the same line are combined with a logical and. At
the end of a line an atom sequence is defined by its first and
last numbers. A sequence of residues can be selected using the
word residue before the numbers. The number of the last atom or
residue may be omitted to select a single entity. Multiple such
lines may be used to construct the mask in an additive manner {\-}
the atom sets specified by each line are combined with a logical
or. If no mask is given, all atoms are selected by default.

\subsubsection{Fragment library file format}
\label{subsubsec:fragment_lib_f_f} \index{library file}The
fragment library file is a text file containing definitions of all
the molecular building blocks, $i.e.$ amino acid residues, ligands
etc., and is used by Qprep to generate a molecular topology from a
PDB file. The format of the library file follows the same standard
as the parameter file. Each fragment/residue entry starts with an
entry name enclosed in curly braces, $e.g.$ {\{}ALA{\}}, maximum 3
positions. The lists of atoms, bonds, etc. appear as sections
within the entry.

The optional [\textbf{info}] section contains the keyword
SYBYLtype which identifies the SYBYL substructure type (residue or
group) for the entry and is used only for writing mol2 files with
Qprep. The [\textbf{atoms}] section defines the sequential number,
name, type and charge of the atoms in the entry. The atom name
must match the name used in PDB files to be read, but the order of
atoms is not important. In the following sections atoms are
identified by their names. The [\textbf{bonds}] section lists all
bonds within the entry. The optional [\textbf{connections}]
contains the keywords head and tail which identify the atoms
involved in inter-residue bonds (head is bonded to the tail of the
preceding residue and tail is bonded to the head of the next
residue). Charge groups are defined, one per line, in the

\subsubsection{Force field parameter file format}
The force field parameter file is a text file, based on the same
standard as the FEP file described in section
\ref{subsubsec:fepfileformat} on page
\pageref{subsubsec:fepfileformat}. It is divided into sections
which can appear in any order and which start with a section title
enclosed in square brackets. The data in the file is the
constants, which are defined for each multiplet of atom types, in

\begin {equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:V_pot2}
 V_{pot} =\sum\limits_{bonds} {\frac{1}{2}k_b \cdot \left( {r-r_0
} \right)^2} +\sum\limits_{angles} {\frac{1}{2}k_\theta \left(
{\theta -\theta_0} \right)^2} +\sum\limits_{dihedrals} {K_\varphi
\cdot \left( {1+\cos \left( {n\cdot \varphi -\delta } \right)}
\right)} \nonumber \\
  +\sum\limits_{\substack{improper \\ dihedrals}}
{\frac{1}{2}k_\xi \left( {\xi -\xi _0} \right)^2}
+\sum\limits_{\substack{atom \\ pairs \; i , \, j}}
{\frac{1}{4\cdot \pi \cdot \varepsilon_0 } \cdot q_i \cdot q_j
\cdot r_{ij}^{-1} +A_{ij} \cdot r_{ij}^{-12} -B_{ij} \cdot
r_{ij}^{-6} }
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The \textbf{[atom{\_}types]} section defines a name, and lists
Lennard-Jones parameters and mass for each atom type. There are
three sets of LJ parameters: set 1 for normal non-bonded
interactions, set 2 for pairs of polar atom types (listed in a the
section LJ{\_}type2{\_}pairs) and type 3 for pairs of atoms in
1--4 position. The B parameter is the same for sets 2 and 3. Atom
type names are alphanumeric. The length of the name is limited to
8 characters.

The section \textbf{[atom{\_}aliases]} is used facilitate the
transition from numeric atom type names used in earlier versions.
In this section alias names may be assigned to atom types defined
in the atom{\_}types section, $e.g.$ to be able to use the old
numeric name as an alias for the new descriptive atom type name in
library files.

The \textbf{[LJ{\_}type2{\_}pairs]} section lists pairs of polar
atom types that should interact with LJ parameters from set 2.

The \textbf{[bonds]} section lists force constant and equilibrium
distance for bonds between two atoms. It contains one line for
each (applicable) unique pair of atom types. The pair 1--2 is
equivalent with the pair 2--1, so only one of these should be
included. The pairs may appear in any order, but for reasons of
readability it is convenient to sort the lines by both atom types
and always have the lower atom type number first on each line.

The \textbf{[angles]} section lists force constant and equilibrium
angle for 3-atom angles. contains one line for each (applicable)
unique triplet of atom types. The pair 1--2--3 is equivalent with
the pair 3--2--1, so only one of these should be included. The
pairs may appear in any order, but for reasons of readability it
is convenient to sort the lines by the middle atom type first,
then on the left and finally by the right atom type. It is also
preferred to have the left atom type less than or equal to the
right one ($i.e.$ 1--2--3 rather than 3--2--1).

The \textbf{[torsions]} section lists parameters for torsion
angles. Torsions can be defined by 4 atom types but in many cases
only the two middle atoms are significant. The latter case is
indicated by "0" (zero) or "?" in column one and four. A torsion
defined with four atom types overrides two-atom definitions. The
force constant in the cosine-shaped function for the torsion
potential is equal to half the barrier height. The periodicity is
the number of maxima passed in a full 360\r{ } rotation. The phase
shift divided by the periodicity is the angle where the first
maximum should be. The number of paths is the number of ways that
a two-atom torsion can be defined, $i.e.$ the product of the
number of atoms bonded to the two middle atoms. It is used to
distribute the force over all the atoms involved. The preferred
order of the lines is analogous with the bonds section: sort by
the two middle atom types. Multiple torsion potential terms may be
defined for the same set of atom types, to enable more complex
torsion potentials. All terms are then added together.

The \textbf{[impropers]} section lists force constant and
equilibrium angle for improper torsion angles, which are modelled
by a harmonic potential. The impropers may be defined by two atom
types, but in many cases the second type is not used and set to
"0" or "?" as in the torsions section.

The \textbf{[options]} section contains three keywords.
Vdw{\_}rule selects the rule for combining LJ parameters from two
atom types and takes the values "geometric" or "arithmetic".
Scale{\_}14 is the scaling factor for electrostatic interactions
between atoms in 1--4 positions. Switch{\_}atoms selects the
cut-off logic for non-bonded interaction: On~=~use designated
switch (central) atoms of charge groups. Off~=~include the charge
groups if any pair of atoms is within the cut-off distance.

Table \ref{tab:prm_f_f} lists the data and units for each column
in the different sections, and an example is included as a file
example on page \pageref{fig:prm_ex}.

\subsubsection{Solvent file format}
\label{subsubsec:solvent_file_format} Qprep can solvate a
molecular systems by filling empty space in the simulation sphere
or box by water molecules taken from a water file. This file is a
special PDB-like file containing a box or a sphere of water
molecules. The residue name in the water file is used to designate
the library entry to use for generating bonds etc.

When using a box for solvation, the box can be replicated in all
direction so that a small box can be used to solvate a big
simulation sphere or box. Spheres cannot be replicated and must be
larger than the intended simulation system. The box or sphere will
be translated to the water generation centre, so the origin used
in the file is arbitrary. A sphere can not be used to solvate a
system intended for simulation with periodic boundaries. The file
format is described in Table \ref{tab:wat_file}.

\subsection{Boundary conditions}
\label{subsec:boundary}
\subsubsection{Solute boundary restraints}
\label{subsubsec:soluteboundary} Solute atoms outside the
simulation sphere are excluded from non-bonded interactions and
are tightly restrained to their initial coordinates by a harmonic
potential with a force constant of 200
kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$Å$^{-2}$. All bonded interactions are
evaluated as for atoms inside the sphere. Solute atoms in the
outermost shell of the simulation sphere are also restrained to
their initial coordinates with a harmonic potential to avoid
distortion of bonds across the sphere boundary. The radius
of this shell and the force constant is given in the Qdyn input
file (section [\textbf{sphere}], keywords shell\_radius and
shell\_force). The restrained shell radius is by default equal to the outer,
\emph{i.e.} no atoms will be restrained unless the restrained shell radius is redefined. The force constant has
a default value of 10 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$Å$^{-2}$.

The grouping of atoms in the inside shell or excluded regions is
done before the simulation starts using the initial coordinates
from the topology and is not updated during simulation. The
initial coordinates for grouping the shell-atoms can also be taken
from or from a separate restraint coordinate file (section
[\textbf{files}], keyword restraint).

\subsubsection{Solvent boundary restraints}
\label{subsubsec:solventboundary}


Solvent molecules near the sphere boundary must be restrained to
avoid "evaporation" and to keep the density correct and uniform in
the whole sphere. A central value in the radial restraining of
water is the effective solvent radius r$_w$, which is only almost
equal to the simulation sphere radius. It is the solution to the
equation $V_{sphere} \left(r_w\right) = \frac{4\pi}{3}\cdot r_w^3
= N_p\left(r_w\right)\cdot v_p+N_w\cdot v_w $ where N$_p$(r$_w$)
is the number of heavy solute atoms within a radius r$_w$ from the
water centre, v$_p$ is the average volume per heavy atom in
proteins (17.3 Å$^3$), N$_w$ is the (fixed) number of solvent
molecules and v$_w$ is the volume of a solvent molecule (29.9
Å$^3$ for water).

The radial restraining potential has a half-harmonic term that
pushes solvent molecules back into the sphere and a Morse-like
term that pulls molecules from inside out towards the boundary
\cite{Essex:1995}:
\begin {equation}
\label{eq:scaas}
 V_{solvent}(r) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2}\cdot K \cdot \left( r-r_0 \right) ^2 - D_e & \text{if r $>$ r$_0$} \\
    D_e \cdot \left( \left( e^{ \left( \alpha \cdot \left( r-r_0 \right) \right)} \right)
     ^2 - 2\cdot e^{ \left( \alpha \cdot \left( r-r_0 \right) \right)} \right) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where r is the distance from the water centre, K is the force
constant of the half-harmonic potential, D$_e$ is the depth
("dissociation energy") of the Morse potential, $\alpha$ the
exponential coefficient of the Morse term. r$_0$ is the effective
solvent radius minus the average deviation distance from the
minimum of the half-harmonic potential at the current temperature
T:  $r_0 = r_w - \sqrt{\frac{k_b \cdot T}{K}}$ where r$_w$ is the
target solvent radius. The appropriate values of D$_e$ and
$\alpha$ depend on r$_w$ and are calculated using empirical
functions calibrated to give correct values for water spheres from
12 to 30 Å:
\begin {equation}
\label {eq:empscaas}
\begin {split}
D_e \left(r_w \right) = 0.26 \frac{kcal}{mol} \cdot e^{\left(
-0.19 \frac{1}{\text{Å}} \cdot \left( r_w - 15\text{Å} \right)
\right)} + 0.74
\frac{kcal}{mol} \\
\alpha \left(r_w \right) = 0.20 \frac{1}{\text{Å}} \left/ \left(1
+ e^{ \left( 0.4 \frac{1}{\text{Å}} \cdot \left( r_w - 25\text{Å}
\right) \right)} \right) \right. + 0.30 \frac{1}{\text{Å}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

K, D$_e$ and $\alpha$ can be set in the input file to override the
calculated values used by default (section [\textbf{solvent}],
keywords radial\_force and morse\_depth, respectively).

Water molecules (in the topology) that are initially outside the
simulation sphere are excluded from the simulation (with respect
to non-bonded interactions and restraints).

Polar solvent molecules near boundary will not be randomly
oriented like in bulk solvent and a restraining force is required
to make the surface solvent molecules follow the probability
distribution of angles between radial axis and dipole vector found
in the bulk solvent. When a net charge in the Q-atoms polarises
the solvent, the distribution of solvent molecule dipole angles
changes. This correction of the average polarisation given by
Born's formula is taken into account unless disabled by setting
charge\_correction to off in the input file. The polarisation
distribution restraints are applied in three thin shells to
minimise the radial dependence of the polarisation which occurs in
a single, thicker shell. The outermost shell is 0.5 Å thick, the
second 1.0 Å, the third 1.5 Å, so the polarisation is restrained
in the outermost 3 Å of the simulation sphere.

The restraining works by sorting the molecules of each shell
according to the angle between dipole vector and radial axis and
applying a force to each molecule i to adjust the angle towards
the angle of molecule i in a sorted sequence of molecules that
follow the target distribution. The potential can be written
$V_{polarisation} \left(\Theta _i \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot
K_{pol} \cdot \left( \Theta _i - \Theta _i^{target} \right)^2$
where K$_{pol}$ is the force constant. K$_{pol}$ can be set in the
input file (keyword polarisation\_force in section water), the
default value is 20 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}\cdot$rad$^{-2}$.

\subsubsection{Periodic boundary conditions}
In periodic boundary conditions (PBC) no restraints as described
in the previous section is applied to the atoms and no atoms are
excluded. This allows larger flexibility in the molecular system
but increases runtime. This section contains some things worth to
keep in mind when using Q with PBC.

The shape of the box may be cubic or rectangular. The cut-off must
never be larger than one half of the shortest side of the box.
This also accounts for the constant pressure algorithm. If the
cut-off is too big, the program will stop.

Particles are moved across box boundaries in terms of molecules.
When simulating a large protein in water solution the option
rigid\_box\_centre should be set to off (false). This means that
the box is in each time step centered around the solutes
geometrical center. If there is no solute the box will be centred
around the geometrical centre of the solvent.

If rigid\_box\_centre is on, the centre of the box will be the
same as given in the topology throughout the simulation. Note
that, if solute is present in a simulation like this, each solute
molecule must be assigned just one charge group. This is done by
changing the library file.

\subsubsection{Constant pressure algorithm}
The constant pressure algorithm is a combination of molecular
dynamics and Monte Carlo volume sampling. A change in volume is
chosen randomly $\Delta V = n_{rand}\cdot\Delta V_{max}$ where
$n_{rand}$ is a random number between -1 and 1 and $\Delta
V_{max}$ is the maximum allowed volume displacement in one move.
The new volume is defined as $V' = V + \Delta V$, prime indicating
the new configuration. The coordinates are then changed, the
system is contracted or expanded. The scaling factor for the side
length of the box, $l_{x,y,z}$ is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{V'}{V}}$, thus
$l'_{i}=l_{i}\cdot\sqrt[3]{\frac{V'}{V}}$.

The proportions of the box are maintained, meaning that a
rectangular box stays rectangular. The coordinates, $r_{x,y,z}$ of
each molecules centre of mass are scaled according to $r'_{i} =
(r_{i}-c{i})\frac{l'_{i}}{l_{i}}+c_{i}$, where $c_i$ is the
coordinate of the centre of the box. This variable is included to
handle the case when the box centre does not coincide with the
origin of the coordinate system. The contraction of expansion is
in terms for molecules, not atoms, which means that all intra
molecular distances are kept fixed.

After a new configuration has been set, the potential is
recalculated. Only the non-bonded interactions need to be taken in
to account because the interior of molecules are not changed. The
Metropolis sampling equation is $\Delta W = (U'_{pot} - U_{pot}) +
P_{0}(V'-V)$, where $P_0$ is the target pressure. The new
configuration is accepted with probability
\begin {equation}
 P(\Delta V) = \begin{cases}
    e^{-\frac{\Delta W}{k_{B}T}} & \Delta W > 0 \\
    1 & \Delta W \leq 0\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

If $\Delta W$ is zero or negative the move is always accepted.
Otherwise a new random number, $n \in [0,1]$, is generated and the
configuration is accepted if $n \leq e^{-\frac{\Delta
W}{k_{B}T}}$. The acceptance ratio is controlled with the variable
max\_volume\_displacement, which corresponds to $\Delta V_{max}$.

\subsection{File and format descriptions}
\subsubsection{Qdyn input file format}\label{subsubsec:Qdyn_inp_file_form}
The name of the input file is passed to Qdyn as the first argument
on the command line. The file is divided into sections, each
starting with a section heading enclosed in square brackets.
Within a section are lines with a keyword and a value, or just
values in a defined order. Comments, starting with `!', `\#' or
`*' may appear after the data on a line or on separate lines
anywhere in the file. The order of sections and the order of data
within sections is not important (but the order of table
\ref{tab:qdyninputfileformat} is preferred). Many keywords have
default values and can be omitted, to make it easier to set up a
simple simulation. The use of default values will be shown in the
output from Qdyn. Sections with no required entries are optional.

\subsubsection{FEP file format}
\label{subsubsec:fepfileformat}

The FEP file which designates some atoms from the topology as
Q-atoms and redefines the topology for these atoms in a number of
states between which transformations can be made, is a text file.
It is divided into sections which can appear in any order and
which start with a section title. Within each section the data
appears either as lines with values or as pairs of keyword and
value.

Section titles are enclosed in square brackets and must be the
first (non-white space) item on a line. They are not
case-sensitive. Keyword-value pairs appear in that order, anywhere
on a line but together on the same line. Keyword-value lines can
appear in any order (within a section). White space is not
significant in value-list lines.

Comments start with "!", "\#" or "*" and may appear after values
or as separate lines.

Only the section atoms where Q-atoms are designated, is required,
all others are optional. They may appear in any order, but the
preferred order is that of table \ref{tab:fepfileformat}. The
section [\textbf{FEP}] contains the keyword states followed by the
number of FEP states defined in the FEP file. An offset value to
add to all topology atom numbers in order to avoid renumbering all
atoms between $e.g.$ free ligand and bound ligand simulations can
also be defined in the [\textbf{FEP}] section. New atom types for
Q-atoms are defined in the [\textbf{atom\_types}] section. The
assignment of Q-atom types to Q-atoms is done, for each state, in
the [\textbf{change\_atoms}] section. Pairs of atoms between which
bonds are made or broken should use the exponential repulsion
non-bonded potential instead of the standard Lennard-Jones by
listing them under the [\textbf{soft\_pairs}] heading. In some
cases it is desirable to completely turn off certain non-bonded
interactions. This can be done on a per-state basis in the section
[\textbf{excluded\_pairs}].

New bond, angle, torsion and improper types can also be defined
and used for any atoms in the topology, not only between Q-atoms.
Atoms are therefore referred to by their number in the topology
rather than by a Q-atom number. Definitions in the topology are
overridden by definitions in the FEP file. To disable an
interaction in one state, a zero should be used in place of the
type number for that state.

Angles, torsions and impropers which depend on the existence of a
bond being formed or broken should be "coupled" to that bond by
scaling the angle energy by the ratio of the actual value of the
Morse bond energy to the dissociation energy. These couplings are
defined in the sections [\textbf{angle\_couplings}],
[\textbf{torsion\_couplings}] and [\textbf{improper\_couplings}].

Extra shake constraints can be imposed between any pair of atoms
in the topology using the heading [\textbf{shake\_constraints}].
The effective constraint distance will be the sum of the distances
for each state weighted by their respective $\lambda$'s.

Quantum-mechanical mixing of states used in EVB calculations by
introducing off-diagonal Hamiltonian matrix element functions is
defined in the section [\textbf{off\_diagonals}].

If vanishing or appearing atoms are part of your FEP strategy, it
may be desirable to use a \textit{softcore} potential for the
Q-atoms in question.\cite{Zacharias:1994} Softcore potentials have
been implemented in Qdyn according to equation \ref{eq:softcore}.
Depending on the value of
\textbf{softcore\-\_use\-\_max\-\_potential} given in the
[\textbf{FEP}] section, the $\alpha$-values are either read
directly from the [\textbf{softcore}] section or calculated by
Qdyn in a pairwise manner based upon the desired potentials at
$r=0$ given in the [\textbf{softcore}] section. Softcore
potentials are only available for Q-atoms, i.e. Q-Q, Q-water and
Q-solute interactions are treated with softcore. In the case of a
Q-Q interaction where both Q-atoms have softcore potentials, the
$\alpha$ which is used is that which gives rise to the lowest potential at
$r=0$.

\begin {equation}
\label{eq:softcore}
 V_{vdW}(r_{ij}) = \frac{A_{ij}}{(r_{ij}^6 + \alpha)^2} - \frac{B_{ij}}{r_{ij}^6 +
 \alpha}
 \text{\hspace{1cm}or\hspace{1cm}}
 V_{vdW}(r_{ij}) = \epsilon\cdot(\frac{{R_{ij}^{*}}^{12}}{(r_{ij}^6 + \alpha)^2} - 2\cdot\frac{{R_{ij}^{*}}^{6}}{r_{ij}^6 + \alpha})
\end{equation}

If periodic boundary conditions are used an additional section
[\textbf{PBC}] is needed. In this section one switching atom for
all Q-atoms is defined. This switching atom is used when
generating the Q-surrounding nonbonded pair lists.

Table \ref{tab:fepfileformat} lists the data and units for each
column in the different sections, and an example is included as
file example on page \pageref{tab:FEP_file_f_p_t_r}.

\subsubsection{Qdyn log file}
\label{subsubsec:qdynlogfiles}

The information from the Qdyn simulation is gathered in a log
file. This log file is divided into two parts, one showing the
initialisation of the simulations and the other showing different
energies form all the steps of the simulation. The units used in
the log files are the basic units in table \ref{tab:units} on page
\pageref{tab:units} and appropriate combinations thereof.

\textbf{Initialisation phase}\\*[0.25cm] In this part of the log
file, all input data from input, topology and FEP files are read
and the simulation is initialised.

\subsubsection{Qfep log file}
[To be added]
\subsection{Differences from earlier versions}

FIX THIS SECTION! Remove, update or put it on the web!

This section is only of interest for users of Q version 3 and
presents the important differences between versions 3 and 4. The
trajectory analysis program Qcalc is added to the package, making
it easy to calculate RMS coordinate deviations (with or without
least squares fitting of structures), distances, angles and
individual bonded force field terms.
\subsubsection{Differences in Qprep}

\begin{itemize}
\item Solvation is done in Qprep, not in Qdyn. The topology thus contains all the atoms of the simulated system.
\item Solvent can be generated using a grid, from a solvent coordinate file or from a restart file.
\item The simulation sphere is specified when generating the topology and exclusion of atoms takes place in Qprep and is included in the topology.
\item Hydrogen atom coordinates are generated by steepest descent energy minimisation of the angle potentials involving the hydrogens, rather than by determining the hybridisation by heuristic rules.
\item The placement of hydrogen atoms may be further controlled by build rules where a torsion angle can be specified.
\item Shake constraints on water angles now require that a H-H bond is present in the library entry. Set the force constant for this bond type to zero.
\item Several previously hard-coded parameters are now user-setable preferences. Use the prefs command to list them and the set command to change.
\item Force field parameters are loaded as a separate step using the readff command, not as part of the maketop command.
\item The addbond command has new syntax and accepts input either as atom numbers or as residue\_number:atom\_name and will warn if the bond distance is large.
\item The xlink command should be called before generating the topology, like the addbond command.
\item Gap markers are not required between fragments without head or tail atom designation, $e.g.$ not between solvent molecules.
\item Overloading of library entries: Loading a library entry with the same name as a previously loaded entry removes the old definition.
\item When loading a topology, all libraries used to make it will be loaded automatically.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Differences in Qdyn}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solvation and definition of the simulation sphere has been moved to Qprep.
\item The keywords centre, radius, pack, model and water are obsolete and ignored.
\item The number of atoms in the topology is always equal to the number of atoms in the simulation, $i.e.$ atoms can not be added by reading a restart file.
\item The CHARM DCD format is used for trajectory files. This file format can be read by visualisation programs like VMD [18] for trajectory animation.
\item Shake can be enabled specifically for bonds to hydrogen atoms.
\item Any tri-atomic molecule may be used as solvent, not only SPC or TIP3P water models.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{proq - PDB file analysis and manipulation}\label{subsubsec:proq}
Proq is an interactive, shell-like program for examining and
modifying pdb files prior to making topology or for analysis of
structures from simulations. It is a non-graphical,
command-oriented program written in PERL, intended to be a fast
and powerful complement to molecular graphics programs. Proq can
handle subsets of atoms, make distance matrices, calculate
midpoints, change protonation states of residues, display charges,
and calculate electrostatic interaction energies.

The contents of a PDB file will be loaded as fragments separated
by comments, GAP marks etc. In the simplest case there will be
only one fragment. The comments will be retained upon saving. Proq
can not add or remove atoms. Change of protonation state is a
matter of changing the residue name, $e.g.$ from ASP to AS-.

A sample proq session is shown below, where user input is shown in
bold face:

 function   &   Interactive, shell-like program for creating
                sequences of Qdyn input files and a command file for running them.
                Mdsh can import existing input files, modify settings using keywords,
                generate sequences of input files with varying lambda values for
                perturbation simulations. It can also be used to easily set up a
                simulation by asking a series of questions. Mdsh script files are
                useful for managing standardized simulation protocols.\\ \hline

Each element of the Qdyn input file is associated with a keyword
in mdsh. The set command changes the values. The keywords in mdsh
are identical to those in the Qdyn input file, except in the cases
listed in the following table:

\section{SYSTEM GUIDE}
\subsection{System requirements}
The Q programs will run under many operating systems including MS
Windows NT/XP, Digital UNIX, LINUX, SGI IRIX, Sun Solaris, Cray
UNICOS. A parallel version using the Message Passing Interface
(MPI) standard is included in Q 5.0.

The memory requirements vary with the size of the simulated system
but are, in general, modest. A system of 18 Å radius with 10 Å
non-bonded cut-off takes about 3 to 7 Mb depending on the computer
and operating system.

\subsubsection{Compilers}
A Fortran90 compiler is required to build the main programs
(Qdyn5, Qprep5, Qfep5, Qdum5, Qcalc5).

A Fortran90 compiler and a MPI library is required to build the
parallel version of Qdyn5.

A Fortran77 compiler is required to build some helper programs
called by proq (disttab, repel, midpoint).

A C compiler is required to build some of the analysis programs
(tstart, ineff).

A PERL interpreter is required to run most of the utility programs
(bone, enob, lsextr, mdsh, mkfep, proq, Qave).

\subsection{Installation}
The following components, available from the Q web site
http://xray.bmc.uu.se/~aqwww/Q, are required to use Q:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Either executable images (available for some popular
        platforms) or source code (to compile on your own system).
\item   Force field files.
\item   Solvent files.
\end{enumerate}
Make a directory such as $\sim$/Q, /usr/local/Q or C:$\backslash$Q
and download the files to this directory.

\subsubsection{Installing executable images}
\textbf{MS Windows systems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Create a subdirectory in the Q directory for the programs,
        such as C:$\backslash$Q$\backslash$bin.
\item   Uncompress the Pkzip archive file containing the windows
        executables to this directory using $e.g.$ unzip or WinZip.
\item   Add this directory to your search path by modifying the PATH
        environment variable in the system properties control panel.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{UNIX system}
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Create a subdirectory in the Q directory for the executables, such as Q/bin.
\item   Extract the executables from the gzip compressed tar archive file into this directory, $e.g.$\\
        \verb"gunzip -c Q_DigitalUNIX4_Alpha21164.tar.gz | (cd bin; tar -xvf -)"
\item   Add the bin directory to your search path by modifying the PATH environment variable
(typically in $\sim$/.cshrc)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Building the programs from source code}
\textbf{MS Windows systems} Project files and workspace file for
Digital Visual Fortran v.6 are provided in the Windows source code
distribution. After extracting the files from the zip archive,
open the workspace file and build the programs using the
configurations (Alpha or x86) that match your system.

\textbf{UNIX systems} The makefile included in the UNIX source
code distribution contains settings (compiler flags) for some
popular platforms including Compaq Tru64 UNIX, Linux and SGI Irix.
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Create a subdirectory in the Q directory for the executables, such as Q/bin.
\item   Create a subdirectory in the Q directory for the
        source files, such as Q/src.
\item   Extract the source files from the gzip compressed tar
        archive file into this directory, $e.g.$\\
        \verb"gunzip -c Q4_src.tar.gz |(cd src; tar -xvf -)".
\item   Type make in the source directory. This will list the platforms supported in the makefile.
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item   If your platform is on the list, enter the appropriate make command, $e.g.$\\
        \verb"make alpha-osf1-ev6".
\item   Please note that the compiler optimisation settings
        in the makefile are in no way guaranteed to produce the fastest
        code. Feel free to try different settings and if you can improve
        the result, please notify us.
\end{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item   If your platform in not on the list, you need to find the appropriate compiler flags yourself and
        edit the makefile accordingly. Consult your F90 manual. Use the generic settings as s starting point:\\
        \verb"make generic".
\item   When you have updated the make file for your system, please e-mail it to us, and we will merge your
        changes into the distributed makefile.
\end{enumerate}
\item   Move the executables to the bin directory.
\item   Add the bin directory to your search path by modifying the PATH environment variable (typically in
$\sim$/.cshrc).
\end{enumerate}
